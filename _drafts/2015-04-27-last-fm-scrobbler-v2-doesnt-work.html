<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2015/04/lastfm.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1440" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lastfm.png" alt="lastfm" width="244" height="215" /></a>This morning, I finally gave up trying to sort out the scrobbling problem I've been having since December. The current Last.fm scrobbler, version 2, is just not functioning, so I've reverted to version 1.5, losing 4 months' scrobbles in the process. Not impressed. Why can't anybody write software that works any more?</p>
<p>The problem has been that although the Last.fm app on my OSX device seems to work, reporting scrobbles normally, these seem to get stuck in cache. In the app, these tracks show as "cached" and do not appear on my last.fm profile.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you're a Mac user having trouble with last.fm not scrobbling your tracks, delete the last.fm scrobbler, empty the trash and download <a href="http://cdn.last.fm/client/Mac/Last.fm-1.5.4.28012.dmg">the older version 1.5 here</a>Â (dmg).</p>

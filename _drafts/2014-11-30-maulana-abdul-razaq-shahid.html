<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/11/Shahid.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1330" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Shahid.jpg" alt="Shahid" width="263" height="270" /></a>I learned today of the death of Maulana Abdul Razaq Shahid. We met almost 20 years ago in the old Dunfermline Mosque when I declared my Shahada. It was packed out, being a Friday Jumu'ah: he put me at ease, although at the time his English wasn't good and my Arabic was weak. I remember him leading a Dhikr - the resonance of it in my chest is something I still remember and feel today. He gave me my name: <em>Muhammad Bilal</em> and although I am not often called "Bilal" nowadays, the significance of the name remains with me.</p>
<p>At regular Friday prayers, he would often lead the Ummah in prayer and recitation that wrenched tears from him: the passion of his faith no less present in his quieter duah'a. After the formal session was over and those who had to rush back to work had left, a small number of us would remain as Shahid led us in singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUhBB2k7oSY" target="_blank">Mustafa Jaan-e-Rehmat Pe Laakhon Salaam</a>. He had a beautiful voice and in a different setting I could imagine him singing professionally. His humility led him on a pastoral path, however: in this role he cared deeply for his community and the people within it.</p>
<p>Those who remember him will miss him.</p>

<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/02/TMLogoILW.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-918" alt="TMLogoILW" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/TMLogoILW-300x81.png" width="300" height="81" /></a>Last week was the University of Edinburgh's<a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/staff-students/students/studies/innovative-learning" target="_blank"><em> Innovative Learning Week</em></a> (ILW). As part of  my contribution to the range of activities and events that make up this amazing opportunity for staff, learners and the wider community, I thought I'd run a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeachMeet" target="_blank">Teachmeet</a>. I was delighted when very quickly, I got some big names signed up to share a bit of good practice and ideas to inform and enthuse: Colin Webster of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (<a href="https://twitter.com/co1inwebster" target="_blank">@co1inwebster</a>); John Connell, the <a href="http://consult.iamlearner.net/" target="_blank">EdTech guru</a>, creator of "I am Learner" and innovator behind the <a href="http://commonlearn.net/" target="_blank">CommonLearn</a> concept; and <a href="https://twitter.com/IanStuart66" target="_blank">Ian Stuart</a>, formerly <a href="https://twitter.com/islayian" target="_blank">@IslayIan</a>, now on secondment to the Scottish Executive and an authority on 1-to-1.</p>

<p>It was with some regret that I had to cancel the event, like many others, due to (I think) the large number of events and the impact on registrations. I decided that 20 wasn't enough for a viable teachmeet in the context of the University, so called it off. By way of compensation, I switched the venue and the context to a pub in Leith, the <a href="http://www.aroomin.co.uk/teuchters-landing-leith/" target="_blank">Teuchters Landing</a>.</p>

<p>I don't propose to detail the entire event: what is worth recording here is that it was a brilliant night, with some amazing stories, tech demonstrations, masterclasses, debate over current policy and the curriculum, great ideas and something very characteristic of almost every teachmeet I've ever been to - the "buzz" of having shared some truly refreshing perspectives. Some of the ideas I picked up included were Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=1995" target="_blank">Physics Illustrator</a> (which evidently has been around for years); information about the new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/z6fsgk7" target="_blank">BBC Bitesize for National 5 Physics</a> and others; and the SQA's unconference site on what education will look like in 2020 at <a href="http://education2020.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">http://education2020.wikispaces.com</a> which outlines what Education 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 look like - "a bit of brick and a bit of click".</p>

<p>I'll leave you with a little quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/arcticlass" target="_blank">Sharon Somerville</a>, a Canadian teacher just back from teaching in the Falkland Islands. This struck a chord with me:</p>
<blockquote><p>People don't have problems, they have needs. Meet a need to enable them.</p></blockquote>

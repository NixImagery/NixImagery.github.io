<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/08/tpi.png" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-723 alignright" alt="tpi" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tpi-300x196.png" width="300" height="196" /></a>I was directed to something called the <a href="http://www.teachingperspectives.com/">teaching perspectives inventory</a>, which I had not heard of before, by a PGDE student at Moray House. She had taken the survey before starting the course to give herself an insight into her own attitudes to teaching and as a benchmark: she intends taking the survey again at the end of the year to try and gauge how much her outlook has changed as a consequence of the year. If you're not aware, the PGDE in Scotland is a one-year professional graduate diploma at Master's level which delivers 18 weeks in university and 18 weeks in school placement. At the end of the year, successful students progress to (paid) probation and on to full registration as teachers.</p>
<p>Those of you that know me will not be surprised that I couldn't resist taking the inventory test myself, to see where I sit in the <a href="http://www.teachingperspectives.com/drupal/tpi/summary-five-perspectives">five perspectives</a> as a fairly new university teacher. <a href="http://www.teachingperspectives.com/drupal/tpi/tpi-results?nodeid=18543&amp;name=Nick">The results</a> are interesting (click the image for the full size).</p>
<p>My dominant perspective according to the analysis is Nurturing: "Effective teaching assumes that long-term, hard, persistent effort to achieve comes from the heart, not the head". I like this. It is characterised by phrases like, "learners [...] are working on issues or problems without fear of failure", "their achievement is a product of their own effort and ability", "[teachers promote] a climate of caring and trust", and "[t]heir assessments of learning consider individual growth as well as absolute achievement".</p>
<p>I am recessive in Transmission: "Effective teaching requires a substantial commitment to the content or subject matter". I think I like this too. My role as I see it is substantially about developing people and their attitudes, over content. In the survey, I am sure I was a little fuzzy with the responses, still being a recent secondary classroom teacher of physics. Although I have a responsibility to challenge student teachers to assess, challenge and develop their physics understanding (and to continue to do so), my more significant task is in areas like pedagogy, complexity, social justice and professional responsibility.</p>
<p>The other three perspectives (Apprenticeship, Development and Social Reform) sit around the mean. I'm not alarmed by this, although my conscience pricks itself when it comes to Development, "Effective teaching must be planned and conducted <em>from the learner's point of view</em>.", because it's one of my mantras. Perhaps my response to the survey brings this out as below dominant because I put this principle into practice by proxy: in my mind as I do my job, above the needs of the students in front of me, are the needs of the young people they will teach. Controversially, my role has been defined by some as "gatekeeper", the one who prevents ineffective teachers from making it to the classroom.</p>
<p>There's more to reflect on here, I think. If you are an educator, you might give it a try yourself?</p>
<p>EDIT: There's more information on teaching perspectives in <a href="http://erikvandusen.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/goodteaching.pdf">Pratt, D. D. (2002). Good teaching: one size fits all?</a>, which includes this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perspectives are neither good nor bad. They are simply philosophical orientations to knowledge, learning, and the role and responsibility of being a teacher. Therefore it is important to remember that each of these perspectives represents a legitimate view of teaching when enacted appropriately.</p></blockquote>

<p>I stumbled across an incredible project yesterday whilst lobbing a few quid into the KickStarter kitty of the makers of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1559170459/the-7th-guest-3-the-collector" target="_blank">The Seventh Guest 3: The Collector</a>. I like T7G and its sister, the 11th Hour, because they are what I wish many more computer games were: things that help the player grow as a person instead of the vast majority of nasty, violent, dehumanising poison that infects the minds of so many young people.</p>
<p>The project I found is called Beeswing and is a creative development by Jack King-Spooner of a handcrafted role-playing game, without violence (or puzzles!), set in rural Scotland. Jack is creating "a world of intertwining stories" within a game setting using beautiful media such as watercolour pictures, graphite sketches and clay animation, all set to original music. From the kickstarter project page:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a story about the past, about community and childhood, attachment and growing up. Scottish folk tales, morally dubious parables, cloudy anecdotes and more contemporary stories of homelessness and immigration all combine to create a truly dynamic narrative.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is lovely enough, but the thing that really caught my attention was the value in the dialogues within the stories: there is a depth to them that goes beyond what you might at first expect. Jack describes them as, "trues stories, blended with fiction". I think this game will have potential to be of great value to teachers in developing connected thinking and critical literacy in children, and a capacity to see the world around them in much more richer terms. Here's an example from the video on the kickstarter project page:</p>
<blockquote><p>I like the scarecrow, I know what it means.<br />
See the flowers in the field? The poppies and buttercups? Rare sight.<br />
They mean there's no pesticide in the fields.<br />
No pesticide means insects.<br />
Insects mean rooks and crows.<br />
Rooks and crows mean scarecrows.<br />
I like the scarecrow, I know what it means.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you liked Inanimate Alice, you're going to love this. Why not click the picture and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/676519884/beeswing" target="_blank">go support Jack</a>? You'll get the game when it's out next year and an opportunity to really develop the children you're involved with. Hurry, there's only a couple of weeks left.</p>

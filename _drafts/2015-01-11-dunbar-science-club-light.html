<p>On Saturday 10th January, young scientists at the Dunbar Science Club learned about lenses and light. Physics graduates undertaking a PGDE (Professional Graduate Diploma in Education) at the University of Edinburgh's Moray House School of Education ran sessions for children aged between 4 and 12.</p>

<p>The sessions began with an introduction to lenses and the question "Did you know that you carry around your own personal magnifying glass?" After looking at lenses and magnifying glasses, the children were guided through their own dissection of a real eye to find the lens inside. The Moray House teachers started the cut with a scalpel to allow the children to complete the opening of the eye using scissors. A gentle squeeze, and the aqueous humour popped out, bringing the lens out with it. Children proved that this is a real lens by reading printed material through it!</p>

<p>Time was very tight in the workshops but some of the children had the opportunity to make a pinhole camera using an empty Pringles tub. Lenses are used in lots of things including cameras but not all cameras need a lens. Early cameras work using just a pinhole: making a pinhole in the bottom of the tub allows light to enter which can be displayed on a screen made from greaseproof paper held onto the top of the tub by an elastic band. Children got to take their camera home.</p>

<p>Finally, the groups had the chance to look at the power of light and the importance of colour. Our young scientists were able to explain that darker colours absorb energy more than light colours. Using this knowledge, they could say that if a laser was unable to pop a yellow balloon, then we should draw a black patch on the balloon. Shining a laser on the patch should pop the balloon because of the extra energy absorbed. Using a special powerful laser (used by astronomers to show constellations in the night sky), this was tested and proved with a bang!</p>

<p>Great fun was had by all. Credit is due to the <a href="http://www.dunbarscienceclub.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dunbar Science Club</a> - the volunteers who run this and the <a href="http://dunbarscifest.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dunbar SciFest</a> do an amazing job bringing great science to the young people of the town. Special thanks to Moray House technical staff and the PGDE teachers who planned, resourced and delivered this session and a big thank you to the Edinburgh businesses that helped us out with some of the equipment we needed: the <a href="http://www.dominioncinemas.net/" target="_blank">Dominion Cinema</a> who provided the Pringles tubs; <a href="http://www.georgebowerbutchers.co.uk/" target="_blank">George Bowers Butcher in Stockbridge</a> who gave us pig's eyes; and <a href="http://welchfishmongers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Welch Fishmongers, Newhaven</a> who gave us haddock eyes. This couldn't have happened without your support.</p>

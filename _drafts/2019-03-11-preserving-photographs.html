<p>A task in the OU/RPS Photography Course TG089 asks, <strong>"Will your great-grandchildren see your photographs? How will they have been preserved?"</strong>. This is my response.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Since 2006, I have uploaded over 30,000 photos to online repositories, mostly Flickr. Only a very few of my images have ever been printed, mostly because they are of only transient or marginal interest to anyone except me. I don't curate much of my work and think that a new image is only of passing interest: photos I post online gather a few "likes" over a day or so then fade into internet oblivion. I do carefully back up RAW files and some of the JPGs I create to a USB disk, "just in case". Of what, I don't think I really know.</p>

<p>Ultimately, all memory will be lost: it is futile to deny that.</p>

<p><em>And another, and another.<br /> He couldn’t stop.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>
<p><em>He wasn’t trying to fill the sea.<br /> He wasn’t trying to empty the beach.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>
<p><em>He was just throwing away,<br /> nothing else but.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>
<p><em>Like a kitten playing<br /> he was practicing for the future</em></p>
<p><em> </em>
<p><em>when there’ll be so many things<br /> he’ll want to throw away</em></p>
<p><em> </em>
<p><em>if only his fingers will unclench<br /> and let them go.</em></p>

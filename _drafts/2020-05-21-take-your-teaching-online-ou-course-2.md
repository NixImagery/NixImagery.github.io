This is the second post in a series of my notes, reflections and links from the [Take your teaching online](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/education/take-your-teaching-online/content-section-overview?active-tab=description-tab) OU course designed to help teachers move from face-to-face teaching to more blended, flipped or online methods. The first post is [here](/take-your-teaching-online-ou-course).

# Week 1: Teaching online is different (continued)

## 1 Synchronous and asynchronous modes of teaching (continued)

### Motivation and support
There are clear social justice issues with online learning, not least the additional effort, expense, technical *savoir-faire* and environmental discipline involved in gaining access, let alone getting access at the right time. No wonder assertions such as this are so easy to make:

> In an online environment, you will likely have learners who are more self-motivated, learners who are more comfortable with online learning, and learners who are less certain of how to interact.

This goes beyond support: the teacher has a role in supporting learners, of course, but can you support the non-participants? The recent [Sutton Trust Report](https://www.suttontrust.com/our-research/covid-19-and-social-mobility-impact-brief) identified the gaps between those who have and those who do not in sustaining access to school during the COVID lockdown.

In planning for online learning, structured tasks with discrete outputs at the start of your course can help identify those of your cohort who need additional support or interventions.

### Discipline
The online environment provides great opportunity for mischief: the chat streams and backchannels can provide a richness to the learning environment not previously available, yet these same channels can be the source of disruption.

> I love the chat. It's the ultimate note-passer.

Online environments offer useful controls, such as "mute all", to the teacher which can help sustain engagement and the flow of a session without too many distractions. I have found that it is hard to identify bullying or isolation of individuals by others in the online environment. Making explicit channels for reporting or support should, in my view, be a key element of any online environment. We cannot ignore the potential for this to become a serious problem, normalised by acceptance of low-level abuse in the online classroom. I am surprised not to see more sites bearing direct links to [CEOP](https://www.ceop.police.uk/safety-centre/) in the UK, offering at least some opportunity for victims of abuse and exploitation to protect themselves.

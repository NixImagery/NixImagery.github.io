<p>...not as I know it.</p>
<p>This evening I attended Teachmeet Fife 2013 at the brand new (I almost wrote "brand spanking new" but thought better of it in light of current educational thinking on discipline) Auchmuty High School in Glenrothes, Fife. I knew the format of the evening was going to be a little different to previous teachmeets I have attended so was a little unsure, but I had some business to do at the school anyway, so signed myself up as a lurker.</p>
<p>The school building and facilities are absolutely beautiful. I was given a wee cook's tour of the place and was impressed at the thinking in the design, the huge investment in new equipment and security, and the quality of the teaching environment the local authority have created in the school. I can't deny I felt a little envious of my friend and guide, who was evidently appreciative of his good fortune to be teaching in such a school.</p>

As with all three sessions I attended, this was not <a href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/69405069/TeachMeet%20Fife13" target="_blank">a workshop as billed</a>, but rather a traditional direct-teaching presentation complete with slides and no interaction. Gemma's presentation was interesting, as were all three sessions I attended, but I was more than a little disappointed to realise that this was a very standard CPD event and not what I have come to know as a Teachmeetâ„¢.</p>
<p>This was brought home to me sharply when I incurred "discipline" from Paul Murray when caught using my phone during his presentation. At a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeachMeet" target="_blank">teachmeet</a>, the use of backchannels and concurrent conversation, often over social media channels, is positively encouraged if not demanded. I was trying to do this as is the custom and practice.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that for many delegates this evening, this was their first teachmeet and I fear they will have an unfair impression of what a teachmeet is. For me, although the presentations were mostly useful and interesting, the lack of the usual pace, dynamics and interactivity left me without the usual teachmeet buzz which often lasts for days and always has some impact on my practice.</p>
<p>Have I gained anything from this evening? Well, yes, of course. I was able to converse with friends and colleagues old and new, to reflect on the things I had heard and to consider how I ought to revise and adapt my own practice in light of these. I am grateful to Gemma and her team for organising the evening, to Auchmuty for hosting us and to BrainPop for sponsoring the event.</p>

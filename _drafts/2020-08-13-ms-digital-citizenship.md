I picked up my MIE [recently](ms-onenote-academy) and have been talking with colleagues about enhancing our PGDE provision by attaching a side-track leading to some kind of digital skills development. One such development track I am already on, the [Student Teacher Education Programme](https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/learningPath/a0fc6e66). Here are my notes from the first module on that path, [Digital Citizenship](https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/learningPath/a0fc6e66/course/192d4b4a/overview)[^barf].

[^barf]: Note. The introductory video required me to turn my self-restraint and reaction suppression dial up to 11. It's full-on Merkin Cheese with a double helping of brand sauce.

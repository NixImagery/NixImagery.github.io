<p>Continuing an act of defiance by taking time out of my work schedule this week, I attended a second lecture by <a href="http://www.veletsianos.com/" target="_blank">George Veletsianos</a> at Edinburgh University, entitled "MOOCs, automation, artificial intelligence, and pedagogical agents". This seminar was a special event put on by DICE - the <a href="www.dice.education.ed.ac.uk" target="_blank">Digital Cultures in Education</a> research group.</p>
<p>The lecture and subsequent discussion was rich and well-informed, as there was a good range of expertise and engagement in the room and from the online participants accessing via the streaming feed. George's lecture was stimulating and provocative: without overdoing the detail, he managed to tackle MOOCs as a socio-cultural phenomenon. He described the usual rationale for MOOCs of costs and the perceptions that drive their explosion onto the educational landscape but he also gave us new (to me) truths about their origin and the assumptions underpinning their popularity.</p>
<p>Moving on to the automation of teaching, George treated us to a quick history, again, touching the nerves of the implementation of human-computer interaction in education. There was much discussion of this with the final topic of pedagogical agents: perhaps misnamed "bots" in the debate that ensued in the question session and on the twitter back channel.</p>

<p>I can't do justice to the scope of the issues raised and picked over in today's two-hour session, not least because of the richness of them. Also, perhaps, for fear of misrepresenting the nuances. I resorted to my comfort zone of scurrilous tweeting, suggesting first that rather than choosing a gender or cultural stereotype for my preferred pedagogical agent, I would choose Brian, the Family Guy dog. This got me followed by Peter Griffin. When I started another cartoon (above), Marshall Dozier <a href="https://twitter.com/mafrado/status/479258965826498560" target="_blank">outed me with a tweet</a>.</p>

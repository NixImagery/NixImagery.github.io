[Take your teaching online](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/education/take-your-teaching-online/content-section-overview?active-tab=description-tab) is a free, self-paced, Open University online course that runs for a nominal 8 weeks, 3 hours per week, and is designed to help teachers move from face-to-face teaching to more blended, flipped or online methods. This page contains my own notes and links from the course.

### Rita

![The OU Rita character][rita]

The course has an online animated character, Rita, a cutesy co-delegate who is following the course alongside everyone else. She models a sort of generic, politically-correct, middle-of-the-road UK teacher, in a way that tries to make us all feel included. I do find it quite patronising at first encounter, but let's see if I warm to the idea as the course develops. I think it's fair to say that the OU are trying very hard to dodge any accusations that their courses are not for everyone.

## Week 1: Teaching online is different

### (A)synchrony
The first concept considered is the contrast between synchronous and asynchronous teaching. Synchronous sessions seem to be good for drop-ins, seminars, or scheduled interactive opportunities for students to resolve issues. Teaching more formally online requires the development of new skills. Asynchronous teaching gives control and responsibility to the students to access materials and communicate together without the teacher's specific instruction. Variation of media is important in this mode, but the benefits to the learner in greater flexibility, for example, are significant. In both modes, collaboration is a powerful pedagogy and needs to be facilitated, required and supported.

#### Activity 1 Thinking about synchronous and asynchronous online teaching
... come up with three short examples that fit the following situations. These could be based on your own experiences of teaching or learning, or a situation that you can imagine:

1. A situation where synchronous learning is appropriate and beneficial in supporting learning.
> The introduction of a new topic or course segment requiring the explanation or demonstration of an overview or concept.

2. A situation where asynchronous learning is appropriate and beneficial in supporting learning.
3. A situation that combines synchronous and asynchronous learning to support learning.

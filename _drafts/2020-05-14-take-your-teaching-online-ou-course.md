[Take your teaching online](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/education/take-your-teaching-online/content-section-overview?active-tab=description-tab) is a free, self-paced, Open University online course that runs for a nominal 8 weeks, 3 hours per week, and is designed to help teachers move from face-to-face teaching to more blended, flipped or online methods. This page contains my own notes and links from the course.

### Rita

![The OU Rita character][rita]

The course has an online animated character, Rita, a cutesy co-delegate who is following the course alongside everyone else. She models a sort of generic, politically-correct, middle-of-the-road UK teacher, in a way that tries to make us all feel included. I do find it quite patronising at first encounter, but let's see if I warm to the idea as the course develops. I think it's fair to say that the OU are trying very hard to dodge any accusations that their courses are not for everyone.

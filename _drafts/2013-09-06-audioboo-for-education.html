<p><a href="https://audioboo.fm/"><img class="size-full wp-image-744 alignright" style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" alt="audioboo-t_7" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audioboo-t_7.png" width="196" height="197" /></a>I've been a user of <a href="https://audioboo.fm/" target="_blank">AudioBoo</a> for some time now, and have recorded a few dozen commentaries, some of which have been listened to thousands of times. I find it an excellent tool for easy podcasting and most of my broadcasts are automatically cross-posted to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/nick-hood/id549233518" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.edutalk.info/?s=cullaloe" target="_blank">edutalk.cc</a>. I'm pleased to find that audioBoo have launched this week a facility for educators who might consider the power of audio for their learners. From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>...we're delighted to announce the launch of Audioboo for Education: a new initiative to help students and educators to enrich the learning experience and encourage conversation and debate through the power of audio.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from ideas and examples of how audioBoo can be used to support and enhance learning, there's also an <a href="https://audioboo.fm/about/education-edmodo" target="_blank">intelligent and useful app</a> for <a href="https://www.edmodo.com/" target="_blank">Edmodo</a>, the VLE of choice for many teachers.</p>
<p>New channels of engagement are essential to the flipped classroom and the enabling of access to education on the learner's terms, which is something that if you're an educator and not driving it, then it will soon be driving you. Why not try it? It's free, it's easy and it offers leverage to your impact on learners: if you want an example, my most recent public talk has reached hundreds more through the podcast than it did in the flesh, so to speak.</p>

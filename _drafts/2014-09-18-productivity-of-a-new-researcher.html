<p>I've spent part of the summer preparing to begin a six-year research project alongside my day job in initial teacher education at the University of Edinburgh. Time is possibly the scarcest resource I have and that preparation has involved assessment and selection of systems that will enable me to be efficient, effective and productive. Here's what I have in current use.</p>
<h3>To-do</h3>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/09/logo2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1245" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/logo2.png" alt="logo2" width="188" height="83" /></a>Keeping a handle on things I have to do, prioritising and postponing according to progress, is essential to getting things done.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/" target="_blank">rememberthemilk.com</a> provides this functionality through a web interface which includes a calendar feed and the ability to add new tasks by sending an email to a private address. A <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remember-the-milk-for-gma/hphjpfmagbhbdfhdndglcccmhdjhjjce" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a> shows the RTM current list within the Google calendar web view and allows task completion or postponing.</p>
<h3>Calendar</h3>
<p><a href="calendar.google.com" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> - or rather, several google calendars - allow me to manage the various demands on my time and keep an eye on events of interest that I'm following. Synching the calendars to the Calendar app on my mac and mobile devices means I know where I'm supposed to be at any time, and what gaps exist for new opportunities. New events (such as seminars booked through services like eventbrite) can quickly be added to the calendars by downloading an ics file. The RTM list and timed events appear within the calendar. On the mac, dates within emails can be directly viewed in your calendar and optionally added, allowing fast and selective adding of new opportunities such as seminars.</p>
<h3>Workspace</h3>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/09/Wiki.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1247" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Wiki.png" alt="Wiki" width="135" height="135" /></a>My study, reading and research diary needs to be quick, easy and searchable. I have set up a <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org" target="_blank">MediaWiki</a> installation on my server at <a href="http://cullaloe.net/w" target="_blank">http://cullaloe.net/w</a> and given my supervisors write access to allow public commentary and guidance that is similarly searchable. I like the wiki markup which is just a small step from plain text - it provides very rapid content-focused editing and light touch formatting.</p>
<p>I have used a couple of extensions for in-page references (<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Cite" target="_blank">Cite</a>) and to make it easy to insert citations (<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Bibtex" target="_blank">Bibtex</a>) to papers and books I am reading, by copying references from Mendeley and pasting directly into the page.</p>
<h3>Citation Manager</h3>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/09/logo-mendeley.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1248" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/logo-mendeley-300x70.png" alt="logo-mendeley" width="300" height="70" /></a>The tool of choice here is <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/" target="_blank">Mendeley</a>, which is a cloud-based bibliography manager with easy import from many formats (including books on Amazon, Google Scholar and the academic libraries). It has a "Save to Mendeley" bookmark for rapid extraction from webpages and a desktop application that synchs automatically to the web database. What I really like about this software is that it allows groups of references to be created which are automatically saved in BibTex files, one per group, which makes compilation against LaTeX seamless.</p>
<h3>Paper/thesis creation</h3>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/09/200px-LaTeX_logo.svg_.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1249" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/200px-LaTeX_logo.svg_.png" alt="200px-LaTeX_logo.svg" width="168" height="74" /></a>What else? LaTeX - I use the <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/" target="_blank">TexShop</a> environment on my mac - produces beautiful documents (output to pdf) in a few keystrokes without any worries about formatting, compatibility or platform, and the almost transparent inclusion and rendering of bibliographies, tables of contents, margin notes, tables, figures and images.</p>
<h3>Clippings</h3>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/09/Evernote-logo-e1362251497276.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1252" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Evernote-logo-e1362251497276-300x300.png" alt="Evernote-logo-e1362251497276" width="94" height="94" /></a>The handiest tool I have to quickly grab things I want to refer to later is Evernote. It has the quick post facility within my browser and the ability to forward emails out of my inbox to a less in-your-face place for later review and action. There's also a nice desktop app to complement the easy web interface. Notebooks can be organised any way to suit you and can be bundled together to manage the important separation between different workflows.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/09/Dropbox-Logo.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1254" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Dropbox-Logo-300x300.png" alt="Dropbox-Logo" width="95" height="95" /></a>Dropbox is one of the services I use for cloud storage. All source files and working documents are kept here. I've been using Dropbox long enough to have earned additional storage free of charge but most of that is taken up in the backup of files for my teachers' site at <a href="http://sptr.net/" target="_blank">sptr.net</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to DropBox, I also make use of I also make use of <a href="https://copy.com" target="_blank">copy.com</a> which works in a similar way. Significantly, I do not use Google's GDrive because I dislike how it works, as much as I dislike Google docs. Having been stung by Google's sudden removal of services I've relied on in the past, such as bookmarks, I am reluctant to rely too heavily on them.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>All of these tools, services and software are free. There are paid services but I am a light enough user not to incur the need to pay the subscription for any of the services mentioned here. That's not to say I'm not willing to pay for these services because they are worth it, but the price points are disproportionate for most of them so I don't volunteer cash I don't have to spend. Service providers, take note: less is more. Cut your fees and more will pay. I do have a Premium Evernote account but only because it's on promotion with O2 at the moment. You will not find Microsoft products on any technology I own.</p>
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>I always take pens and good-quality plain paper notebooks with me wherever I go. Email is ever present on a mobile device or laptop, as is my calendar, dropbox and browser. Also mobile but less central to hour-by-hour workflow are Evernote and Mendeley. I manage RTM only via a browser, and editing the workspace wiki is easily done there also. Chrome is my browser of choice on all of my devices - all the bookmarks synch automatically. It is likely that I will try other tools from time to time but I do not have the luxury of time to trial alternatives: my focus has to be on being effective if I am to meet current aspirations and obligations.</p>
<p>I hope this entry has been of interest - please get in touch if you have a suggestion to make, especially one that might make my life easier.</p>

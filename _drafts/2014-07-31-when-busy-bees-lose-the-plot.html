<p>OK, I have all this stuff to do but somehow I just can't get focused on doing it. I seem to be stuck here, in the wrong place, doing something that just isn't my priority right now.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I like being a bee and collecting pollen and all that stuff for the hive but honestly, I'm knackered. I just want to sit here and look at - what is that, anyway? Some kind of pipe. Interesting. I like pipes. Think I'll blog about pipes.</p>
<p>Where was I? Oh, yeah. I'm going to go and get some of that pollen. For the hive. Because it's what I'm supposed to be doing right now.</p>

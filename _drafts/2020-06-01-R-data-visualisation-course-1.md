These are my notes from a course on Statistics and (data) Visualisation with R, presented by [Lucia Michielin](https://edinburgh.academia.edu/luciamichielin) of the University of Edinburgh. The course ran two days a week in June and July.

## The learning environment
The course was presented in a blended form using Collaborate, Blackboard Learn and Slack. These represent three key elements in a remote learning environment:

* Synchronous, whole-class activity, usually instructor-led, but may include "break-out" sessions for students to work together in groups.
* A resources repository for files, course outlines, presenter's notes and assignments.
* A back-channel for students to interact in, and for interaction with the course leader. This may be synchronous and asynchronous.

Collaborate has a chat facility which I have used for the back-channel in recent remote teaching, but this is only available synchronously. The offline chatter and forum space is useful in courses like this, which is why Slack is such a useful tool here. Microsoft teams has been suggested as an equivalent to Slack but I really don't find it intuitive or useful in the same way as Slack. The UI, as with all Microsoft products I have ever used, is difficult and intrusive.

## Preparation
The pre-course task is to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [R-Studio IDE](https://rstudio.com/). I painlessly installed on my Mac R 4.0.0 "Arbor Day" and R-Studio 1.3.959, and downloaded the data files for the first week.

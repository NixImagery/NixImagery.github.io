I'm signed up for a course at the University on Statistics and (data) Visualisation with R, presented by [Lucia Michielin](https://edinburgh.academia.edu/luciamichielin) of the University of Edinburgh. The course runs two days a week for 8 weeks and is being presented within Collaborate.

## Preparation
The pre-course task is to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [R-Studio IDE](https://rstudio.com/). I painlessly installed on my Mac R 4.0.0 "Arbor Day", which is different from the legacy version 3.6.3 referred to in the installation notes, and R-Studio 1.3.959.

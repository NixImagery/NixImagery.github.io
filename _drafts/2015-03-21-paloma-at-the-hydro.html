<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1409" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/FullSizeRender-300x158.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender" width="300" height="158" />What better way to start the weekend than with a Friday night on Pacific Quay in a nice hotel, some quality food and tickets to see Paloma Faith and her amazing band at the Hydro?</p>
<p>I'm a serial Paloma fanboy since I first saw her perform at the Corn Exchange a few years ago. Every gig is different and yet her performances are as fresh and fun as the first. We bolted from work Friday afternoon and had time to check in and freshen up atÂ the <a href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/GLAPAC/glasgow-pacific-quay-secc" target="_blank">Premier Inn</a> before going for a pre-booked (seriously, you have to pre-book) bite to eat at the <a href="http://www.yenrotunda.com/" target="_blank">Yen oriental in the Rotunda</a>.</p>
<p>We arrived fashionably late, just as the support, <a href="http://www.vintagetrouble.com/" target="_blank">Vintage Trouble</a>, were getting into their pumped-up and lively set designed to get even the most reserved of English audiences twitching in their seats: as Paloma said later, Scottish audiences need no such warm-up as they are already "smokin' hot". We were on our feet, whooping and hollering as the lead singer Ty Taylor and his LA band gave it all. You remember Ty from his incredible duet at the BBC Proms with Paloma of Etta James' "I'd rather go blind". If you missed that, your life isn't complete. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ95vBg_ick" target="_blank">Youtube it now</a>.</p>
<p>The main event started with a dramatic drop of the white curtain that had covered the main stage set-up which was not dissimilar to the arrangement we saw at the Clyde Auditorium last year: white, white and more white, with blue contrast in the band's clothes and the singers' incredibly funky outfits. I thought the sound was a little lost for sharpness in the massive Hydro auditorium but lost myself in the music, along with the 80 million other people in the venue (may be an exaggeration). We danced, and sang and let the happiness that the performers had for their work wash through us as the set progressed to an outstanding orgy of well-kent numbers and the hide-and-seek of the encore game.</p>
<p>A brilliant night out in Glasgow, with the cherry on the perfectly iced cake for me being another chance to see my favourite, favourite bass player Andrea Goldsworthy do her stuff. I may have got a little over-excited in the cheer for her, as one of our new friends in our row patted me on the arm and said, "steady on there, boy". I don't care. I had been having the best fun in ages: the hallmark of a Paloma Faith gig.</p>

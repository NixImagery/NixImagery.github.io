Having spent time thinking about the principles and approaches I will be taking with my teaching in the new semester, now I must move to thinking about the tools that I will be using. 

## Goodbye, Moodle
For the past 3 years, I have used a Moodle instance to support and communicate with students in preference to the University's BlackBoard Learn. The main reason for this (there are several) is that Moodle is user-centric with features like search. Learn doesn't have that, and is one of those systems that is designed for the designer, not the user.

Moodle has increasingly become more costly to sustain because of a series of ongoing bugs, most recently following the upgrade to 3.9, search has stopped working. Now, I'm a busy person and don't have time to debug this right now, so I have decided that I need to use a more stable system of tools. 

## Community
One of the single most important aspects of learning is the community you learn with. Former students have continued to access their Moodle course for a long time after the PGDE ends. I don't want to abandon them, or break that community, so I have set up a Slack workspace for former PGDE Physics students, including those more senior who did not have the Moodle experience. So far, they have responded well to the idea. I will be using Slack to connect to the new cohort, outside of the official channels which they cannot join until they matriculate in September. This will give them a head start on building community.

<p>WordPress is a brilliant tool, probably the best of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">CMS</a>s - <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=blogger,drupal,sharepoint,wordpress" target="_blank">Google says so</a> - but every now and then it can stop you in your tracks. It did this today as I was setting up a new site for <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Walker" target="_blank">Marc Walker</a>, the British Biathlon veteran and team manager who is retiring from Her Majesty's service in August to set up a very special personal trainer business in Knutsford.</p>

<p>I hit a wee problem with an unexpected redirect loop when trying to access the back end. There are plenty of articles and "fixes" available on the web, none of which were relevant to my installation and most of which relate to permalinks and .htaccess. Because my installation is a long-standing derivative of WPMU or multi-site, it could not have been that.</p>
<p>For others in the same position, here's what my install looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>LAMP hosted (on a VPS)</li>
<li>Version 3.9.1</li>
<li>Multiple WP sites, domain-mapped</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a while ago, for some reason I have now forgotten, network disabled the default WordPress themes. When I added this new site, created the new admin user and mapped the domain, I found that the admin or login pages simply got stuck in a redirect loop.</p>
<p>The fix was easy enough - I simply had to enable Twenty-Fourteen (the default WP theme) for the new site via the network admin panel.</p>
<p>If you want to visit Marc's new site, it's atÂ <a href="http://avantgardept.com/" target="_blank">AvantgardePT.com</a>. His new business will start up in August and will have a strong European baseline from his track record in Biathlon, military fitness, Iron Man, and an impressive bunch of competitive sports.</p>

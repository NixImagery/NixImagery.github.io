<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1325" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MV5BMjIxNTU4MzY4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM4ODI3MjE@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg" alt="MV5BMjIxNTU4MzY4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM4ODI3MjE@._V1_SX214_AL_" width="214" height="334" /></a>I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/" target="_blank">Interstellar</a> last night. After all the hype and ravings of friends who had seen it, I was disappointed. This three-hour epic story had the style of 1970's sci-fi, with heavy elements of fantasy clumsily stitched together with a good deal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark" target="_blank">shark jumping</a>. The most striking thing about the movie is the blind insularity of its American cultural setting: the mid-West is suffering from food shortages caused by blight of major crops and American astronauts save the day. The star-spangled banner is spangled everywhere you look.</p>
<p>As well as the food problem, there is an unexplained problem of dust, perhaps due to soil erosion from the decimation of crops. Up steps the hero who mysteriously finds himself at a secret NASA facility near his farm. By now the plot punchline has revealed itself. The story tries to bring some cool popular physics ideas to the fore, with black holes and wormholes key features of the eventual trip to space to save the human race, or at least the white Americans of the corn belt.</p>
<p>There is much of the physics in the film which makes it attractive for a school trip: Scottish Higher students should be able to have fun picking over the many movie-maker's errors: the twin paradox, relativity, gravitational gradients, event horizons and some very basic Newtonian mechanics are all at the Godzilla level of believability. There's a lot more in the rich seam of "Hollywood Physics" throughout this story.</p>
<p>The signature US film-maker's stereotype is predictably here: there's a woman on the mission, and she makes the stupid mistake that signals that things are all going to go wrong. A change of genre appears when Matt Damon goes rogue in proper B-Western fashion and attacks the Sheriff. The movie passes through a pale imitation of Kubrick's 2001 before getting a little emotional, staying just short of melodrama before delivering the final credibility <em>seppuku</em> by sending the hero back for the stranded girl.</p>
<p>This is a horribly narcissistic movie about Americans saving America/The World (the terms are interchangeable in this context) with ignorance, A Bad Guy and some nauseating moralising, badly done. I wish I'd gone to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/" target="_blank">the Turing film</a> instead.</p>

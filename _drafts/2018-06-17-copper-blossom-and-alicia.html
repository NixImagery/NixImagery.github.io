<p>We found a new place for our annual June birthday lunch: <a href="http://www.copperblossom.com/">Copper Blossom</a> on George Street and North Castle Street. The menu is varied and inviting, with a range of great food from "bites" to deli sandwiches, to a full Sunday Roast.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3070" align="alignright" width="299"]<a href="https://cullaloe.com/files/2018/06/IMG_7459.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3070" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7459-637x1024.jpg" alt="Alicia Ukelele" width="299" height="480" /></a> Alicia Ukelele[/caption]</p>
<p>I settled on ham and eggs and it was excellent: tender and perfectly cooked gammon under a light glaze, a perfectly fried duck egg and home fries in a bucket. There's a short wine list that covers most preferences and a similarly short but irresistible dessert menu. The horror of there being no trifle left was amply mitigated by a compensatory Eton Mess that did not disappoint.</p>
<p>One particular delightful surprise was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aliciaukulelegirl/">Alicia Ukelele</a>, who sang for all of us as we enjoyed our meal. She has a really good voice and interprets a great catalogue of songs in a way that's summery and joyous. I particularly loved her rendering of Joni Mitchell's "A Case of You". Alicia is a <a href="https://www.aliciamusictherapy.com/">music therapist</a>Â and that's not a surprise when you hear her performing.</p>
<p>You can hear more of Alicia over at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aliciaukulele">Soundcloud</a>, or better still why not go along to Copper Blossom and see her live on a Sunday afternoon?</p>

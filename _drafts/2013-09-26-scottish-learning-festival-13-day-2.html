<p>I was lucky enough to be able to attend both days of the SLF this year. The focus on the second day for me was very much that of professional development for teachers.</p>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/09/grid1.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-786" alt="grid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/grid1-271x300.png" width="271" height="300" /></a>This began with a little reflection on the variability in the quality of CPD accessed by teachers. In my experience, this has ranged in two dimensions from very good to very bad and from relevant to irrelevant. I was thinking in particular of Wednesday night's teachmeet, which, like all teachmeets I've attended, contained a range of talks and professional development which I would plot somewhere mid-to-right-of-centre on our grid, ranging between Â±70% of the relevancy scale. The plot shown here is meant to be representative, not a specific critique of any presentation or session.</p>

<p>Petra Wend chaired a round table session with some of her colleagues on the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/Teaching/CPD/NationalImplementationBoard">National Implementation Board</a> providing short stimulus talks: Graeme Logan, Susan Quinn and Glenn Rodger. Delegates, aided by table facilitators, debated several questions around the challenges faced by the NIB and came up with a number of key questions which expressed the consensus of the principal concerns of those present. The output of the round table will be published at the <a href="http://teachingscotlandsfuture.org.uk/">Teaching Scotland's Future</a> website. Whilst you're clicking around, take a look some of these other places, too: firstly, the <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/aspiringteachers/about/index.asp">Aspiring Teachers</a> site which includes a check of literacy and numeracy for those thinking about a career in teaching in Scotland. Are you up to the minimum standard to teach here?</p>
<p>Second, the <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/resources/f/frameworkforleadership/index.asp">Framework for Educational Leadership</a> is of direct relevance to you as a teacher, even if you think that "leadership" is something that ambitious, unprincipled putative deputes are desperate to shove up your nose. We are all leaders of learning and the opportunities provided by CfE to break out of the silos that have traditionally bunkered our creativity are going to be realised when all teachers take on the mantle of true educational leadership in order to bring the best of opportunities to their students. Look out for the development and sharing of good examples, called for by delegates at the round table today. Get ready for the Scottish College for Educational Leadership, coming very soon. There's a heads-up on <a href="http://engageforeducation.org/2013/06/margery-mcmahon-blog-the-scottish-college-for-educational-leadership/">Margery McMahon's blog</a> (I was at Margery's table today).</p>
<p>Finally, is the <a href="http://www.gtcs.org.uk/professional-development/practitioner-enquiry/what-is-practitioner-enquiry.aspx">GTCS Practitioner enquiry</a> resource which will give you a heads up on the new expectations for all teachers to evaluate methods, ditching those that don't work and replacing them with those that do, based upon evidence from action research in their own classrooms.</p>
<p>The last session I attended at the SLF this year was a good example of practitioner enquiry and professional update: Caroline Bayne and Pauline Gilhooley gave a fascinating presentation of Edinburgh's model for professional development course called, "Enhancing Classroom Practice", which follows a well-established model rooted in masters-level reading, critical thinking, practitioner enquiry and reflection. Broadly the model follows these steps in three phases of the course, which will not be unfamiliar to those who undertook the Chartered Teacher programme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature review</li>
<li>Critical reading</li>
<li>Research methods</li>
<li>Changes to practice</li>
<li>Measurement of impact</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the Edinburgh course does not as yet attract accreditation, it looks like it might be possible in the right partnership with a local university and I am sure that dialogue along these lines will have taken place.</p>
<p>I'll wrap up my report of the second day of the SLF with a (remembered) quote, shared by Professor Wend in the round table this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>research shows that having better qualified teachers results in better learning experiences</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I would rather this was stated as "better educated" teachers, but the point is well made. If you know what you're doing, then what you do, you do better.</p>

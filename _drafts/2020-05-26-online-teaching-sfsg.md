Like others, you assert without evidence that making shy young people present “will help ensure” they become confident somehow. How do you know that?
In groups, consider what specific advice you would offer next year’s PGDE students about this challenge from their tutor.

I liked the breakout groups. The stimulus for thought at the end was interesting, especially as there were different levels to engage with it.

Breakout groups were good for engagement and keeping me interested in the discussion.  Giving us a small stimulus and letting us get on with it worked well I thought.

Thanks, good session today, good amount of content w/o overloading, and good balance of big  group and breakouts

The later sessions have been more interactive and using the breakout rooms and mixture of chat and voice has been much more productive/engaging. Miss not having coffee and cake and drawing posters together though.

Useful as always. Ideas for practical online delivery as well as things to think about speaking to potential mentor in school. Cheers

Stars: I liked the breakout groups and discussion on stimuli. Wish: I disliked the assumption we could all get a dog- sore point when your dog is in West Cork in a pandemic

And some reassuring chat about probations was appreciated 

Emma

Nice wholesome session, Breakout sessions really make it interactive for us. Which is an improvement I have seen over the weeks. (I was very tired today which I did not speak a lot so sorry for other groups who had me in their group). Could possibly keep some of the weekly challenges we did a few weeks back and allow someone to tackle it? Just my opinion though.

Enjoyed the frequency of the breakout groups today they seemed to come at just the right time and varied the pace of the tutorial. Particularly liked the last stimulus and got me thinking reflectively as a learner and teacher.

<p>So, we thought we'd catch up on Channel 4's <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/humans">Humans</a> with some popcorn. On with the Sky box and the telly and press the TV guide. Catch up. Here we go. Microwave is on. Sounds of corn popping.</p>
<p>Sky says we have to contact them because that channel isn't free to view on demand on the downstairs telly. Weird. We can watch Channel 4 for free on the internet-connected upstairs telly OK, but we wanted to sit with our popcorn, now ready to eat, downstairs.</p>
<p>OK, no problem. XBox. There's an app.</p>
<p>XBox says it won't connect to the internet because it wants to do an update first. Sake.</p>
<p>Update eventually installed and restarted and we can sign in and find the app. It needs installed. No problem. Popcorn almost finished now. App installs, but Channel 4 wants us to sign in. Why?</p>
<p>We can't sign in, we don't have an account. Why would we have an account for a free-to-air TV channel? It seems we have to visit their website first to create one. Uckfay offhay. Have you people never heard of GDPR?</p>
<p>Popcorn finished. The moment has gone. Casualty it is.</p>
<p>Bring on the AI revolution! Technology is no threat to us.</p>

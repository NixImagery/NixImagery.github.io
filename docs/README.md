# NixImagery.github.io (formerly cullaloe.github.io)

This repository is the source for a blog that contains posts on coding, technical matters and things related to my online services like the VPS that hosts the various websites I operate. Some of these posts have been migrated from the old WordPress site.

The site is based on [Jekyll Minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) and now includes Kushagra's [search](https://github.com/chinchang/super-search).

I am a Senior Teaching Fellow at Edinburgh University and maintain an interest in programming and artificial intelligence. You can find my current cv [here](http://cullaloe.com/cv.pdf) (pdf, 100kB).

        <title>Knowledge exchange and impact</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in one of the online seminars in the University’s Researcher Development Series, entitled “Knowledge exchange and impact”. Whilst my research is, so I thought, a long way from having impact on the wider world, I attended this to understand what these terms mean in relation to academic research in the university. Although I have been at the University for a decade, my contract has never had a research element to it but now as a (very much part-time) PhD researcher, I thought it might be good to know about these terms &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:disclaimer&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:disclaimer&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session was presented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/sarah-mcgeown&quot;&gt;Dr. Sarah McGeown&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/judy-robertson&quot;&gt;Prof. Judy Robertson&lt;/a&gt;. Sarah began by distinguishing between &lt;em&gt;Knowledge exchange&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Impact&lt;/em&gt;. This was the first revelation to me as I had always thought of it as &lt;em&gt;Knowledge exchange and Impact&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowledge-exchange&quot;&gt;Knowledge exchange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exchange in this idea is the exchange of knowledge with non-academic audiences: the wider world beyond the narrow confines of people who spend their lives knowing about the nitty-gritty of this stuff. The wider audience can include partners or participants in the research. The exchange can come about through giving public talks or webinars about the research, running workshops (for practitioners, for example) and through networks and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge exchange makes impact more likely but not it does not necessarily make it happen. More than once during the seminar, both Sarah and Judy pushed back against the sense that research isn’t worth doing if it doesn’t have demonstrable, verifiable, REF-able impact. There is clearly a hierarchy of some kind here and, as with many things in civilised society, those of greater perceived value attract the money. That’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ref.ac.uk/about/whatref/&quot;&gt;what the REF is all about&lt;/a&gt;, of course, as it determines where the research funding goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, knowledge exchange has great value, and why wouldn’t it have? Finding things out is the stuff of science and human endeavour, and sharing new learning, new ideas, or new ways of thinking can surely only make the world a better place. The trick with sharing learning, as any teacher will tell you, is to pitch at the right level. Knowledge exchange, in seminars, workshops, publications, and so on, should therefore align with the audience, by using appropriate vocabulary, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impact for our purposes is “impact beyond academia”. It can be an outcome from knowledge exchange but not all KE has impact in this sense. Impact, to be counted towards the REF, the UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ref.ac.uk/about/whatref/&quot;&gt;expert review process&lt;/a&gt;, is evaluated as part of that process. It is one of three assessable elements in a submission to the REF, the other two being &lt;em&gt;quality of output&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;environment that supports research&lt;/em&gt;. Examples of impact which may be evaluated include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;policy change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;practice change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;testimonials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;citations in public reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considerations for researchers when takign account of impact in their research include thinking about the users and beneficiaries of the research; how this is facilitated; preprints to allow citation of the work before it is published; how might the imact be amplified; and how it might be quantitatively or qualitatively evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judy and Sarah described briefly examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact&quot;&gt;REF impact case studies&lt;/a&gt;, the first being &lt;a href=&quot;https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/7ea90219-1c95-4bd3-a9b2-4ebdda93af77&quot;&gt;Developing and implementing a new computing science curriculum in Scottish schools&lt;/a&gt;, in which research contributed to improving digital literacy through the curriculum and teacher capacity. This project included both empirical and theoretical aspects, with impact being corroborated by independent evaluators. The second example was &lt;a href=&quot;https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/ab8df6c7-4f32-49b4-9703-3b64f17598fa&quot;&gt;Improving reading and challenging gender stereotypes in Scotland&lt;/a&gt; which changed literacy practice and influenced national programmes, also contributing to parliamentary debate on raising attainment in literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-learned&quot;&gt;What was learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Judy and Sarah reflected on the experience of submitting to REF 2021. I got the distinct impression that this is not a trivial task, and reading the two impact case studies betrays great authority, very calmly stated. This is the stuff of aspiration yet our hosts were in no way elitist in their tone, talking as they were to an audience which included a good number of post-graduate researchers. They encouraged participation in networks outside of academia in order to provide opportunities for knowledge exchange, and to make use of support from within the university, including the School’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/education/rke&quot;&gt;RKE Directorate&lt;/a&gt;. My own question, whether to write research questions with intent to have impact, was pragmatically dealt with by, “get your PhD first”. I loved that response.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to make Hollandaise sauce</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9940 Large.jpeg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Creamy Hollandaise&quot; /&gt; New Year’s Day and the resolution list includes being more confident in the kitchen, so I aksed Alexa for a recipe for Hollandaise, which she obliged me with, from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/hollandaise-sauce&quot;&gt;BBC Good Food website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very simple and straightforward and any fule can make this. Start by clarifying half a pack of butter in a small pan, skimming the white solids off the top as you heat it. Meanwhile, whisk up a couple of fresh egg yolks with white wine vinegar, a little salt, and a splash of cold water in a glass bowl, transferring the bowl to sit over some softly simmering water after a minute or two. Continue whisking until you get a nice pale, thick sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and gradually whisk in the butter to make a rich, creamy Hollandaise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place all of the pans on the side ready for cleaning, and open a jar of Tesco’s Finest Hollandaise sauce to spoon over your poached egg.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wordle cheating with R</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is not really about cheating Wordle, it’s about how to produce quick documents that include nice graphical representations of small sets of numerical data. A common scenario is in looking at the distribution of marks across a batch of assignments – has this group of students performed better than another, have I been particularly generous with my marks compared with last year, that kind of thing. Teachers assess all the time, and will often then obsess over just how objective they have been about it. A picture of the marking data can offer a clearer insight than just a table or list of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;r&quot;&gt;R&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to address installing R on your machine. There is a lot of very good information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html&quot;&gt;how to do that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quick-and-dirty-boxplots&quot;&gt;Quick and dirty boxplots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I finished marking a small batch of essays and want to see how the cohort have done overall, beyond my subjective feeling that they did OK. From a terminal, start R:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;R
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will start a session and tell you which version of R you are running. Now, it’s just a matter of typing in your numbers. They don’t have to be in any particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boxplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;68&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;72&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;horizontal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;TRUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot&quot;&gt;boxplot&lt;/a&gt; showing that your intuitions were OK. Doing well, with a reasonable median (the thick line).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/22-11-17-boxplot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to compare 2 sets, give &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; 2 vectors (a vector is a list or collection of data, constructed thus &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c(43,44,56,76)&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boxplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;68&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;72&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;68&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;horizontal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;TRUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/22-11-17-boxplot2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reusable-histograms&quot;&gt;Reusable histograms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want a template to re-use for different data, or for data that you want to update from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NY Times Wordle app asks if “Something doesn’t look right”. To me the plot looked a bit skewed towards the stupid end, and so I decided to play with the app to make my stats look symmetrical. I do the puzzle every day in a web browser, find the answer, and then do it again on a different machine – the one that stores cookie data and remembers my stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, I created an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; markdown document which contains both text and images, calculated from the figures in the document. You can use any text editor to create the document (I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://macdown.uranusjr.com/&quot;&gt;MacDown&lt;/a&gt;) but make sure the file extension is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;, so that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; knows to process the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code blocks. Here’s the source of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Wordle.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; file containing my dishonest stats. They are in the brutal lines constructing the vector of guesses, for example, these show that I have guessed the word in 2, a total of 17 times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;stats&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;subtitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;It&apos;s only a game&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Nick Hood&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;\today&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pdf_document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;documentclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;scrartcl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;en-GB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;papersize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;a4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;fontsize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;11pt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;margin=2cm, bindingoffset=0.5cm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pagestyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;headings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;fontfamily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;roboto&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;fontfamilyoptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;sfdefault, light&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;{r data, echo=FALSE}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;Guesses&amp;lt;-c( + 
rep(1,times=6), +
rep(2,times=17), +
rep(3,times=51), +
rep(4,times=77), +
rep(5,times=67), +
rep(6,times=23), +
rep(7,times=16))

hist(Guesses,breaks=0:7,col=&quot;#CCCFFF&quot;, main=&quot;Guess distribution&quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;
The NY Times Wordle app asks if &quot;Something doesn&apos;t look right&quot;. To me the plot looked a bit skewed towards the stupid end, and so I&apos;m playing the app to make my stats look symmetrical. Of course it&apos;s cheating but it&apos;s not just editing the cookies to make the numbers look right. That would be &lt;span class=&quot;ge&quot;&gt;*cheating*&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now send this file as a script to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;Rscript &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;rmarkdown::render(&apos;Wordle.Rmd&apos;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which produces a pdf document (see the output option in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; file) that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Wordle.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the solution to the biggest problem, but I found it useful for making nice graphical images from small data sets. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is perfect for that, and this gets you started without too much fuss. Try copy-pasting the boxplot into an email next time you discuss marking assignments with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zettelkasten, or connecting ideas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been struggling with stuttering engagement with reading in my PhD, with the consequence that I feel as if I do not yet have a coherent overall picture of the concepts I am trying to master, nor that I am making meaningful connections in the literature. A friend and colleague introduced me to the notes and ideas tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, based on Luhmann’s &lt;em&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/em&gt;, or card index system of connecting ideas &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Schmidt2016&quot;&gt;(Schmidt, 2016; Schmidt, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capturing-information&quot;&gt;Capturing information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of reading, at least in the context of a research project, is to assimilate interesting ideas and findings into your particular context. For the researcher, this context may be defined by the research question(s), or the topic of a literature review. Early attempts at this might involve highlighting passages of interest, or making marginal notes or underlining in the text. These “captures” are not much more useful than merely downloading interesting papers as pdf: all you end up with is a large collection of files, at best organised in folders. Referencing tools like Mendeley offer the ability to store notes with the files, which still avoids the intellectual engagement required to make sense of a broad literature base, or indeed, of trying to identify what is not there – the elusive “gap in the literature” that the research aims to fill. More is required: key ideas are needed to be processed and understood in order for meaning to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One cannot think without writing.” – Niklas Luhmann &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Ahrens2022&quot;&gt;(Ahrens, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capturing-thought&quot;&gt;Capturing thought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This processing requires effort and the deployment of language: ideas from reading may be paraphrased and meaningfully summarised as short notes. These are more than a simple statement of the “essence” of a paper, although this may be considered the minimum example. One academic has described as “thesisable prose”, the notes taken from a reading, paraphrased and restated within the reader’s context. This infers that what you write down at the time of reading needs to make sense at the level you are working, not only to others but also to your future self. How many times have I read my own notes and cursed myself for being too terse, too clever, or too sloppy? The advice I have from my supervisors is to read with the research question in view – to help sustain focus and avoid rabbit-holes, but also to keep the questions themselves under constant critical evaluation. This advice is meaningful at my early stage of a research project like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-discipline-of-metadata&quot;&gt;The discipline of metadata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisation and structure of this library of collected thoughts and summaries is crucial for it to become useful. The usefulness goes beyond simply offering rapid retrieval of ideas and a tidy desk: it offers a reflective surface with which to interact, to provide deeper understanding, to make new meaning, to notice and make new connections, and to see your topic in the literature more comprehensively, complete with its gaps and inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptive words may be used to categorise and group notes: academic readers are already familiar with &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;author&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;keywords&lt;/em&gt; as descriptive metatdata about a published paper. Hashtags are a modern take on this, to associate information and ideas around a theme. These tags make searching easy, collecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23birds%20%23feather&quot;&gt;#birds of a #feather&lt;/a&gt; together. A unique number or code for each note allows them to be referenced in other notes, connecting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zettelkasten&quot;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Niklas Luhmann’s method of making such notes, each is written on a uniquely-numbered paper slip (in German: &lt;em&gt;zettel&lt;/em&gt;) and placed in order in a box (&lt;em&gt;kasten&lt;/em&gt;, plural &lt;em&gt;kästen&lt;/em&gt;). Although Luhmann’s card numbering was used only to uniquely identify each card&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:rbdms&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:rbdms&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the numbering used may suggest a hierarchy of ideas; cards may reference others by the number of the referenced card; tags may be applied to collect and group ideas across hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbering system of Zettelkasten is illustrated by &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Schmidt2016&quot;&gt;(Schmidt, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1/1 Card with notes 
    1/1a Card containing notes referring to a concept/idea from card 1/1 
    1/1b Continuation of notes from card 1/1a 
        1/1b1 Card containing notes referring to a concept/idea from card 1/1b 
        1/1b2 Continuation of notes from card 1/1b1 
1/2 Continuation of notes from card 1/1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of this is to deliberately avoid imposing structure on the notes as they are made, so as not to force thinking into a one-time-and-for-ever way of thinking. The principle is to allow the author to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes&quot;&gt;a conversation&lt;/a&gt; with the collection of ideas, as they are made, and later, as they connect to existing thought. Luhmann called the system his “secondary memory” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Schmidt2016&quot;&gt;(Schmidt, 2016)&lt;/a&gt; to almost infer a thinking partner in the process of reflecting on and interrogating his own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luhmann was famously very productive, writing over 60 books over 40 years, from 90,000 hand-written notes which he organised in boxes, and indexed. The index or register provides a list of &lt;strong&gt;entry points&lt;/strong&gt; for each topic or keyword and is the first of four kinds of links used in the Zettelkasten system, only two of which are useful in a digital implementation. The other type of link is card-to-card, or &lt;strong&gt;hyperlinks&lt;/strong&gt; between related ideas. This makes the cards, texts that refer to other texts: they are &lt;em&gt;hypertext&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Berners-Lee1992&quot;&gt;(Berners-Lee, 1992)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;obsidian&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href=&quot;https://takesmartnotes.com/tools/&quot;&gt;are several programs&lt;/a&gt; with which one may use Zettelkasten but I was specifically pointed at Obsidian and so tried it. The cards in this program are individual Markdown files, which sits well with my existing working habits. All of the written work I do, pretty much is in markdown (including the document you’re reading). I already have 20,000 words in my PhD files in the form of markdown, so this provided a rapid leg-up into Luhmann’s methodology, although not as immediate as I thought at first. This is because one the principal features of Zettelkasten is its atomicity: each card holds a single piece of knowledge, if you can picture such a thing. The cards are not chapters of books, nor papers on a topic: they are ideas, which may be linked to other ideas or classified in some meaningful way. The first task I had to do with (a copy of) my various pieces of writing around the subjects in my PhD is the break them into little pieces, each piece a detail, or aspect, of something larger: the hard work in creating and sustaining this workflow, and which Luhmann said occupied much of his productive time, is in connecting new cards into the exisiting deck. Here we can see that the process of engaging with reading is not a trivial task at all, but one in which all of one’s mental faculties are brought to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luhmann added references directly as he created a new card &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Schmidt2016&quot;&gt;(Schmidt, 2016)&lt;/a&gt; but also regularly refreshed and updated them. There were “hub” cards which arise where cards have a higher number of links to other cards: we might picture these as nodes in the Obsidian graph view of our collection of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9690.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image was a screenshot from the mobile version of Obsidian, which allows me to use the program in the same way as I do on the desktop: I can edit, link and even dictate new notes on the fly: it’s not necessary to buy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/sync&quot;&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/a&gt; subscription if you work in the same virtual space: for Apple infrastructure users, this means the iCloud Drive &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ic-fix&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ic-fix&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. My Zettelkasten is pushed from there on the desktop to its home in a GitHub private repository. The program does quite a lot of the work for us, without excusing the author from tending to proper tagging and referencing. An example from my own “card” collection:&lt;/p&gt;

William Benjamin recognised the significance of time in his &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;radio pedagogy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;Radio%20pedagogy.md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, as an essential part of the power of the medium. The setting of a story in space and time has been called the chronotope [@Bakhtin1981 119].

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been just an introduction for me to this “way in” to better writing productivity in my PhD. The tip came at the right time for me, at a point where I was struggling with momentum. I am thankful to Ramsey Affifi for sharing his practice with me, and to Sönke Ahrens, whose book has just arrived and is the subject of my close attention for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;later-edited-november-2022&quot;&gt;Later (edited November 2022)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ditched using Zettelkasten after a few weeks. I found that building and maintaining the &lt;em&gt;kasten&lt;/em&gt; to be the main focus of my energy instead of reading and writing. I became more focused on form than function and quickly, this method got in my way. Because I am very much a part-time researcher (I have very much a full-time job), this was wasteful. I still largely agree with Luhmann’s quote above, that “One cannot think without writing”, so when I do engage with my research project, I am doing just that. I am glad I tried this approach though, it certainly looked useful for some projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IoP Stirling Conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With a little nervousness, the Institute of Physics (IoP) returned to Stirling for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stirlingmeeting.org/&quot;&gt;47th Stirling Physics Teachers Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, centre piece to the year’s CPD events offered or organised by the IoP including the 3-day residential school for teachers of which the conference forms an integral part. I joined delegates at the Stirling Court Hotel as much to re-connect with the physics teaching community after COVID as for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stirlingmeeting.org/programme&quot;&gt;programme of events&lt;/a&gt;. This reflection is based on notes taken on the day; any errors or omissions are my responsibility. The sketches are for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference theme was “Energy and Sustainability” and it was opened by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lftspace&quot;&gt;Dr. Laura Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, Chair of IOP Scotland after the first generous opportunity for networking around the exhibition space and coffee. Exhibits were relevant and interesting including a “help yourself” table of vintage physics books from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.djb.co.uk/&quot;&gt;djb&lt;/a&gt;, showing off the sustainability spirit before we even got started. Laura reviewed the work of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iop.org/physics-community/iop-membership-where-you-are/iop-scotland&quot;&gt;IoP in Scotland&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of years, including the committee work and that of the IoP coaches in running CPD events and supporting teachers in schools and colleges. She also highlighted the “girls into physics” events which are starting up again, and the national &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iop.org/strategy/limit-less&quot;&gt;Limit Less&lt;/a&gt; campaign to “support young people to change the world and fulfil their potential by doing physics”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was smooth and coherent, and nobody noticed the change in the running order from the advertised programme. As well as energy, there was a strong thread of making visible career pathways for children in the physics classroom. Three presentations from industry were connected by a real sense of optimism and opportunity for our children and their futures, right here in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fusion-power-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Fusion: power for the future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Glasgow’s &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9677.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Declan&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/staff/declandiver/&quot;&gt;Prof. Declan Diver&lt;/a&gt; taught us that we don’t say “nuclear power” any more when talking about energy choices, because for most people this is synonymous with “nuclear waste” and the connotations of that are negative. Nuclear fission (“splitting the atom”) is not a sustainable source of energy (and never has been), whereas nuclear fusion is, especially now that some of the challenges have been overcome: we now speak to the public (and in classrooms) of “fission” or “fusion”: they are not the same and there is no waste with fusion, quite the reverse. Recent breakthroughs in the exhaust system have enabled fusion processes to be demonstrably self-fuelling as the tritium required is a product of the process of taking very low gas density hydrogen at a very high temperature and producing neutrons from it. The energy is captured from these neutrons in a lithium blanket to ultimately heat steam and drive turbines to generate electricity. This process is the other way of doing fusion: the physics teachers in the room were familiar with stellar fusion in which particles are brought together under extremely high pressure. The fusion in a tokamak is achieved by accelerating particles to high energy states using an electromagnetic field – as particles are driven around a circular path in the torus they increase the probability of a collision and thereby fusion reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hydrogen gas is required to be in the form of a plasma, a gas of free charged particles, and this is achieved in a toroidal&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; magnetic chamber (“tokamak” from the Russian). Production devices are more spherical and the first STEP&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is expected to be online before the target date of 2040. Site selection for &lt;a href=&quot;https://step.ukaea.uk/&quot;&gt;the first UK station&lt;/a&gt; is under way and one of five contenders is at Ardeer in North Ayrshire, also famous for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Ardeer_Nudist_beach&amp;amp;params=55.614508_N_4.714867_W_&quot;&gt;nudist beach&lt;/a&gt;. If selected, construction begins there in 2023 on a brownfield site once an ICI works. 3,500 people will be involved in the 8-year build and 1,000 will operate it. The STEP sites are highly compact, occupying only 100 hectares (one square kilometre) to generate between 100 and 200 MW of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declan opened his talk with some motivators: between 4.2 and 8.7 million people are killed every year by burning fossil fuels; we have just over 10,000 days until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy&quot;&gt;net zero carbon emissions in 2050&lt;/a&gt; and it is impossible to meet energy demand within those targets using other renewable energy sources. Ardeer is the only Scottish site under consideration for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Five-bids-shortlisted-to-host-STEP-fusion-plant&quot;&gt;UK STEP project&lt;/a&gt; and although those other renewables sources are still required, the selection of Ardeer would be a significant factor in growing and sustaining Scotland’s already credible expertise in new energy production and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;careers-in-the-physics-classroom&quot;&gt;Careers in the Physics Classroom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9678.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Carol&quot; /&gt;Carol Davenport, director of Northumbria University’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://nustem.uk/about/people/&quot;&gt;nustem project&lt;/a&gt; gave delegates a call to action and seminar on how teachers, in particular physics teachers, might approach promoting STEM careers in their classrooms and why they should be doing so. She described how the number one career influence on young people is their family, and number two, ahead of careers advisors, friends, people in the field, employers or careers fairs, is teachers. For young people over 16 in physics and mathematics, their motivation is informed by key adults, how well they understand the subject and how well they have been taught. Teachers clearly have a role to play that ought not to be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol urged us to avoid the “one-shot” special sessions on careers, rather, to use a drip-feed approach, seeking opportunities in schemes of work to connect, perhaps through starter activities, the course content to a real-world application. I am not sure that this is the right place for this because of the constraints on time to discuss and ask questions which children who are genuinely interested in following up need to satisfy. Rather, a fracture point within a lesson sequence might provide a realistic space, with examples or even an external visitor (in person or digital) input. Carol suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; as a resource to find those people you know, or who might be in your school area, willing to speak to young people about what it’s like to be a {&lt;em&gt;insert STEM profession here&lt;/em&gt;}. Her idea of creating an alumni group to enable and sustain contact with former pupils is a cracking idea but this needs to be owned and managed by the school to avoid it disappearing when a teacher moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nustem have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nustem.uk/activities/&quot;&gt;collection of activities&lt;/a&gt; around STEM careers and what people in these jobs do for a living, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://nustem.uk/careers/&quot;&gt;career cards&lt;/a&gt; linked to the English curriculum. Carol seemed to respond positively to my suggestion that they follow the Imperial College’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reachoutcpd.com/&quot;&gt;ReachOut CPD&lt;/a&gt; example of connecting the resources to CfE E&amp;amp;Os, specifically for Primary teachers who will also make great use of such a resource if that is done. Primary teachers in Scotland have a particular workflow that is understood by Imperial, hence their tagging of their CPD units by experiences and outcomes of the Scottish curriculum. The nustem activities and resources will, in my view, be similarly accessed if these keys are available to teachers, and more to the point, are not likely to be used if they are not. These teachers just don’t have the time to translate Key Stages and curricular references from the English culture that dominates nustem at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice touch with the nustem &lt;a href=&quot;https://nustem.uk/primarycareers/&quot;&gt;Primary Careers Tool&lt;/a&gt; is the hidden keywords in the image search links on each card, designed to compensate unconscious bias being exacerbated by Google’s image search bias. For example, on the card for &lt;a href=&quot;https://nustem.uk/careers_resource/mechanical-engineer/&quot;&gt;mechanical engineer&lt;/a&gt;, the image search phrase is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mechanical engineer AND female&lt;/code&gt;. Clumsy, but effective in presenting counter-stereotypical images to your children of what mechanical engineers look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final powerful tool amongst the many great ideas Carol shared with us was the phrasing of career-oriented questions for young people: less, “what do you want to be when you grow up?” or “do you want to be a pilot?”, and more, “could you be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nustem.uk/careers_resource/marine-engineer/&quot;&gt;marine engineer&lt;/a&gt;?”. Follow the link to that card and read the attributes: young people might like the idea of a job that asks them to be “passionate, imaginative, open-minded” in an environment that features working in and around water. Triggering the imagination seems to be key, and I remember seeing myself in various roles as influencing my own choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-energy-system-of-the-future--one-innovation-at-a-time&quot;&gt;Building the energy system of the future – one innovation at a time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9679.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Neil&quot; /&gt; For me, by far the most inspirational talk of the day was given by Neil Kermode&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, MD of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emec.org.uk/&quot;&gt;European Marine Energy Centre&lt;/a&gt; (EMEC Ltd.) in Orkney. His engaging and entertaining yet punchy style told a story of innovation, creativity and resilience in design against the challenge to harvest the natural resources of the UK in terms of tide and waves. His Orcadian perspective placed his business firmly on our maps in a way that is immediately useful in our classrooms to connect the physics curriculum with exciting innovation and opportunity. EMEC are essentially a research and testing facility for tidal and wave energy capture that is supporting the development of our own secure energy supply for the future. Neil estimated that 20% of the UK energy demand might be met from the seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no trivial task, however, because there are design and infrastructure barriers to overcome which require the attention and commitment of government, which seems to be starting to manifest itself in Scotland, if still underdeveloped in Westminster. Neil said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If you build the infrastructure, stuff happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with my own view on the role of government on behalf of society. No roads, no commerce, no growth. No brainer. Extend that idea to the national grid, to terminals, to communication, and there the doors open to innovation and an energy-rich future for us all. It’s not rocket science, though, as Neil suggested: it’s much, much harder than rocket science in terms of the environment and scale of the devices under test. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://orbitalmarine.com/o2/&quot;&gt;Orbital O2&lt;/a&gt; tidal turbine is 74 m long, has 10 m blades turning on legs under water containing “salt and biology”, generating up to 3 MW of power. Think of the mechanical forces acting on those bearings and structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger challenge is how to make use of the energy captured, when Orkney isn’t on the 20th century national grid? Here’s where the innovation really sparkles, in my mind, because using electrolysis to generate hydrogen and ammonia for storage from air and water is one thing: going beyond that to generate synthetic hydrocarbon fuels that will allow us to continue to aviate is something else. These are not pipe dreams or science fiction: &lt;a href=&quot;https://invinity.com/flow_battery_plus_tidal_green_hydrogen_orkney/&quot;&gt;flow batteries&lt;/a&gt; are working at EMEC; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=73721&quot;&gt;Hydrogen-electric aircraft&lt;/a&gt; are flying; good examples of what Neil called, “learning by doing”. He left us with another quote, this time from John F. Kennedy’s address before the Irish Parliament on June 28th 1963:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics, whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things that never were, and ask why not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lunch-and-the-afternoon&quot;&gt;Lunch and the afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Networking is a hugely important part of an event like this, not least for connecting with new people and re-connecting with old friends and colleagues, but because it’s the most effective way that I know of improving teaching and learning in our classrooms. Dialogue, challenge, swapping ideas and making promises to follow up are crucial to stimulating reflection and improvements in practice. Lunch allowed this, of course, and so did the raggedy end of the day after the afternoon presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got less from the presentations in the afternoon than those in the morning for a couple of reasons. The first, was given by Jonathan Prescott, sales manager for  Mitsubishi Electric (Living Environmental Systems Division) who make heat pumps for the domestic and commercial markets. He explained a bit about what these are and how they work, which was interesting, and offered anyone who wanted it a visit for pupils to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coolingpost.com/uk-news/mitsubishi-invests-15-3m-in-livingston-factory/&quot;&gt;factory in Livingston&lt;/a&gt;. I have spent too long in sales to enjoy a sales pitch, even one in this context. More info if you want it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://les.mitsubishielectric.co.uk/homeowners/our-heat-pumps&quot;&gt;ecodan.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;. For me, Jonathan’s talk didn’t speak to the expectations that the morning had raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final session seemed to be something of a compromise, based on a much longer workshop on the Physics of Climate Change, given by IoP coaches Allan Reid and Andrew Bailey. I am not sure it worked much for me, mostly because I had trouble following what was happening, focused as it was on the intimacy of the front row of the audience. The workshop was based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.perimeterinstitute.ca/collections/lesson-compilations&quot;&gt;Perimeter Institute&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Evidence for Climate Change&lt;/em&gt; enquiry-based lesson compilation which includes a range of activities for children to engage with, alongside video resources. They are certainly worth following up for any teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in breathing, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/&quot;&gt;Keeling Curve&lt;/a&gt; used by Allan and Andrew in their talk is worth spending a few minutes studying with a cup or glass of something reassuring. It will underscore the motivation for the theme of today’s conference and perhaps focus us all on why the innovation and efforts we heard about today are important and worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-and-next-steps&quot;&gt;Conclusion and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing up these notes has been helpful in making sense of what I learned at the conference. I have promised to arrange a meeting for my technician and I with Norman at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sserc.org.uk/&quot;&gt;SSERC&lt;/a&gt; to pick his brains on the zeitgeist of Scottish Physics practical work, so we can better prepare our students for it as they go on their placements and begin their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those readers who might seek further resources, let me recommend the Institute of Physics &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.iop.org/&quot;&gt;IoP Spark&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.iop.org/stories-physics&quot;&gt;Stories from Physics&lt;/a&gt; downloadable pamphlets. These are full of accessible, fascinating tales of invention and discovery around the major themes of classroom physics. Good pedagogy, as I tell my students, is like telling a story. I heard some great stories today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;who, I hope, can forgive my artistic impression in the margin. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Chicago author-date with ibid</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my supervisors recently suggested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Just a stylistic thing going forward, but where you have recently cited the same author, you can use Ibid (e.g. (Ibid: 2) or similar), rather than include their names again”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great advice and something I had seen before. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/DOWNLOAD-DESKTOP/&quot;&gt;Mendeley Desktop&lt;/a&gt; as my academic library and reference manager, which plays nicely with my &lt;a href=&quot;/phd-workflow-22&quot;&gt;writing workflow&lt;/a&gt;. I am used to using the so-called “Harvard” citation style, otherwise known as “author-date” because it looks like this: &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#bresson1999the&quot;&gt;(Cartier-Bresson, 1999)&lt;/a&gt; but had not worked out how to have the software automatically detect when &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt; is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to it is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://citationstyles.org/&quot;&gt;citation style&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file that tells your typesetting program how to format citations. There are thousands of these, publicly accessible over at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/styles&quot;&gt;Zotero Style Repository&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to use a popular &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;csl&lt;/code&gt; style using the globally recognised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/&quot;&gt;Chicago Style Manual&lt;/a&gt; but the use of &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt; has been deprecated there. They favour the use of a short form citation which is well suited to the numbered footnote alternative to author-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little leg work I found that it is quite easy to adapt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-author-date&quot;&gt;the current Chicago author-date&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file to include the &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt; feature from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-with-ibid&quot;&gt;its numbered footnote sister&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-adaptation&quot;&gt;The adaptation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with a copy of the author-date &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file (obviously change the name), find the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;citation&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag and merge the equivalent code from the fullnote with ibid &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file. It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;citation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;et-al-min=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;et-al-use-first=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disambiguate-add-year-suffix=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disambiguate-add-names=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disambiguate-add-givenname=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;givenname-disambiguation-rule=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;primary-name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collapse=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;year&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;after-collapse-delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;prefix=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;(&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;suffix=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;choose&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;position=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid-with-locator&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;term=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;point-locators-subsequent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/group&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/if&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;else-if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;position=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;term=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/else-if&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;else&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;contributors-short&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;date-in-text&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;point-locators&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/group&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/else&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/choose&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/group&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/layout&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/citation&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also necessary to pull in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point-locators-subsequent&lt;/code&gt; macro. Paste it below the other macros in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is required now is to point the rendering software to the style file, in my case, by editing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; header in my markdown document, or the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file for this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel that I should push this back to the open source repositories because it’s just my own hack that works for me, but you can download my version of &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/docs/chicago-author-date-with-ibid.csl&quot;&gt;chicago-author-date-with-ibid.csl&lt;/a&gt; to adapt for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>PhD Tools and software</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I responded to a Twitter conversation about software used to write a thesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Markdown, Pandoc to pdf with Mendeley. I edit in VSCode, and config manage using GitHub. If anyone at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MorayHouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@MorayHouse&lt;/a&gt; wants a demo/tutorial, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nick Hood (@cullaloe) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cullaloe/status/1494320531436228613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Christina_Mik&quot;&gt;@Christina_Mik&lt;/a&gt; asked for a demo, which I am happy to do in person but haven’t the time to make a video of. What I have done instead is to adapt notes from the online thesis to describe the workflow and tools I am using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;platform&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try as much as possible to eliminate duplication of both effort and data and have learned that text-based files free me from the tyranny of proprietary idiosyncracies. All of what follows can be achieved on pretty much any modern computing platform: Windows, Linux, whatever. The main platform I use is a MacBook Air running macOS Big Sur 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workflow&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have three kinds of document to produce. The first kind are short, maybe only one to a few pages, or a presentation file, usually in the form of a printable pdf. Next, are the public articles such as the one you are reading. Finally, there are extended works which should be kept private but sharable until they are ready, like a thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all three kinds of document, I use plain text files which are readable across many platforms, and which are easily backed up and managed. I absolutely do not care about formatting whilst I am writing, it is just a distraction: I can get a machine to make it pretty when I am ready to publish or share. Here is a graphic of my writing workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the net output is in two files: the &lt;strong&gt;markdown text file&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;bibtex file&lt;/strong&gt; containing all of the sources I have cited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;citation-and-referencing&quot;&gt;Citation and referencing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/&quot;&gt;Mendeley&lt;/a&gt; is a reference manager suite that includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/mendeley-desktop&quot;&gt;desktop application&lt;/a&gt; to access and manage your own library of references, and generates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibtex.org/&quot;&gt;bibtex&lt;/a&gt; files which can be used by text processors. Note that the desktop application is not being supported now: there is a newer and much less useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/download-reference-manager&quot;&gt;Mendeley Reference Manager&lt;/a&gt;. Many users have been lobbying Elsevier, who own Mendeley, to reinstate the Mendeley Desktop app or add its functionality to the new Reference Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most useful feature of Mendeley Desktop, apart from importing and managing my reference library, is the automatic creation and update of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file of the entire library, or optionally, separate bib files for each folder. The bib file is used by \(\LaTeX\) and pandoc when generating your document output, to insert correctly formatted citations and your bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;document-production&quot;&gt;Document production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my documents are written in some form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For writing casual or stand-alone documents (reports, presentations, articles), I may use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://macdown.uranusjr.com/&quot;&gt;Macdown&lt;/a&gt; open source Markdown editor for macOS, but more often there are several documents “on the go” at once within the same folder, when I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; IDE &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wssat&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wssat&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; easiest to use for editing. It can be used to edit csv &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wassat2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wassat2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; files with &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/janisdd&quot;&gt;Janis DD&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv&quot;&gt;Edit CSV&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a visual of how the three types of document are produced from the markdown source file and the bibtex file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stand-alone-documents&quot;&gt;Stand-alone documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; is used to generate stand-alone documents from markdown source with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc&quot;&gt;pandoc-citeproc&lt;/a&gt; taking care of linking to bibliographies. Diagrams in these documents (like the graphics in this post) are produced using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raghur/mermaid-filter&quot;&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt; filter for pandoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents written in markdown often include a short &lt;a href=&quot;https://yaml.org/&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; header containing information about it and instructions for pandoc, etc. Here is an example markdown document, with a YAML header:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a pdf of this document using pandoc, we type this in a terminal window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pandoc &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; filename.md &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; filename.pdf &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--citeproc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It produces &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/docs/filename.pdf&quot;&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

My (non-public) thesis website is made using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookdown.org/&quot;&gt;Bookdown&lt;/a&gt; R package &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Xie2016&quot;&gt;(Xie, 2016; Xie, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, which itself uses pandoc to generate HTML, Word and pdf documents.

&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which renders files uploaded and hosted there. It is possible to have GitHub use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; but I prefer to build the pages on my local machine and have GitHub render static HTML. I have found this to be more stable and less prone to attack. Read more about that &lt;a href=&quot;/jekyll-update-via-rake&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;deploy-jekyll-site-from-github&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not related to general projects but certainly useful in mine is the ability to capture for my own use, BBC radio programmes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer&quot;&gt;get_iPlayer&lt;/a&gt; is a command-line programme written in Perl which downloads TV and radio programmes from BBC iPlayer/BBC Sounds &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#notnac2021&quot;&gt;(“Get-Iplayer/get_iplayer,” 2021)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source documents and data files, all in text format, are retained in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NixImagery&quot;&gt;GitHub private repository&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does that mean that everything is backed up against loss or damage to a computer, it is also protected against me: I can roll back changes if I need to, or launch my computer off a cliff without losing my work. Not likely, but you wear a seat belt, don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IT Futures Conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: these are notes from my own perceptions and any errors of understanding are my personal responsibility. &lt;em&gt;Caveat lector.&lt;/em&gt; The sketches are for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of the 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itfutures.ed.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;IT Futures Conference&lt;/a&gt; was “Hybrid and other teaching changes in a Post-COVID world.” The conference has missed a year for well-kent reasons and returned as an experiment in hybrid conferencing. Delegates could register for in-person attendance at the superb McEwan Hall or participate digitally. I chose to attend in person because for me, it is the bits in between the formal sessions that make a good conference and I hoped for that serendipity found in these places. I wasn’t disappointed and had some inspiring, challenging and rich conversations with those delegates and presenters I spoke to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;morning-sessions&quot;&gt;Morning sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference, as in 2019, was opened by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/principals-office/principal-biography&quot;&gt;Prof. Peter Mathieson&lt;/a&gt; who suggested that we might be in for a 10-year ride on the COVID-19 rollercoaster, laying down the first wash of assumptions that would pervade many of the messages from the conference about the hybridisation of university teaching. We are to assume hybrid, or at least, digital first perhaps as we expect campus life to modernise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9542.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Siân and Ben&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/sian-bayne&quot;&gt;Prof. Siân Bayne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/ben-williamson&quot;&gt;Dr. Ben Williamson&lt;/a&gt; presented a picture of the future of universities using a structure of &lt;em&gt;Modes, Frictions, and Futures&lt;/em&gt;. Siân began with Modes, describing the evolution of the university from &lt;em&gt;Elite&lt;/em&gt;, “Ivory Tower” places which may be accessed by only the privileged few of society; &lt;em&gt;Mass&lt;/em&gt; mode places of learning and research using a “Factory or Entrepreneur” image to relate their purpose and population; and finally, the &lt;em&gt;Universal&lt;/em&gt; mode, characterised as “Networked” or “Ecological”.  Siân asked, “where are we now?” on this journey, highlighting perhaps, Ben’s first of five controversies or frictions, that of &lt;em&gt;Fictional Futures&lt;/em&gt;, which are proposed and expected by technology, investors and consultancy businesses and all of which drive towards further exploitations; the fictional expectations of such proposals are intended to produce certainty, to anaesthetise those who might question these expectations. Ben’s use of scare quotes when highlighting the phrase “digital transformation” in the corporate materials promoting these fictional futures, was hilarious. Recently this tech domination of education has become exacerbated by mergers and the creation of monopolies in certain spaces in education technology. Ben cited the example of the merger of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005749/en/Anthology-and-Blackboard-to-Merge-Creating-a-Leading-Global-Provider-of-Education-Software-and-Solutions&quot;&gt;Anthology and Blackboard&lt;/a&gt;. The other three frictions were Educational Technology/Eco Futures; the automation of education in platforms like Coursera; and “Cloud campuses” and the dominance of AWS in the provision of large elements of education infrastructure. The last part of this session was around &lt;em&gt;Futures&lt;/em&gt; and prompted a lively Q&amp;amp;A session which expressed the alarm felt in places about the corporate dominance of a few enterprises; the potential of open source to push back against this; and the weakness of claims that hybridisation is either cheaper or more ecologically superior to more traditional models of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-colm-harmon&quot;&gt;Prof. Colm Harmon&lt;/a&gt; considered what might be expected by way of student experience in the next few years. He celebrated the achievements the university has made in the past two years in relation to the digital provision and claimed that we’re good at it. &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9546.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Rhona&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctl.ox.ac.uk/people/rhona-sharpe&quot;&gt;Prof. Rhona Sharpe&lt;/a&gt;’s lively and interactive session asked what we might carry forward in our teaching practice from our experience of hybridisation. She described the changes in policy at Oxford which have emerged from the dialogue that they (as everyone else in teaching in FE/HE) have had with students during the time of rapid change. What they discovered, interestingly, and which was referred to in a number of discussions today, was that which any decent primary or secondary teacher has known for their entire careers. These professional educators (cf. someone who assumes that they can teach merely because they know about their subject) have always known that good teaching begins and ends with the pupil. It has taken the pandemic to make many institutions turn around and speak seriously to their students: the incredible discoveries made by Oxford and Edinburgh include things like the importance of mental health. The importance of recognising the diversity of cultures, contexts and needs amongst not only the students but also the tutors, the technicians and the servitors, all of them involved and deeply committed to making the world better the only way we know, that is, the development and growth of its people. Those of use who teach at Moray House have known this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If the needs of the disabled students are met, then the needs of all students are met.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote from Rhona’s presentation struck me particularly as an illustration of the stance taken by those who have noticed their disabled students – by which I mean those who are slightly different in some way from the median – recognising that diversity is the norm and the acceptance, celebration and exploitation of that diversity is what ought to be at the heart of any future of education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;afternoon-sessions&quot;&gt;Afternoon sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief summary of the “meet the speaker” sessions, the afternoon’s sessions were more showcase and discussion on innovation taking place now in the university, not just in response (reaction?) to the pandemic. &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9545.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/staff/ashley-lloyd&quot;&gt;Dr. Ashley Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; of the Business School told the story of the development of one of his courses under the title of “pivoting a large class and teaching team”, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-timothy-drysdale&quot;&gt;Prof. Tim Drysdale&lt;/a&gt; showed off his remote access practical labs at &lt;a href=&quot;https://practable.io/&quot;&gt;practable.io&lt;/a&gt;. I had a play with a simple harmonic activity on this system and it’s pretty good – most definitely a better experience than the ubiquitous online simulations found in every hybrid physics or engineering course. There’s nothing like the real thing, of course, but I found this to be significantly superior to HTML5 animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further presentations from IAD’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/about-us/staff/profiles/celeste-mclaughlin&quot;&gt;Celeste McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; and other course leaders around the university took place within the after-space of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-neil-m-speirs&quot;&gt;Dr. Neil Spiers&lt;/a&gt;’ superb challenge to what he called “digital triumphalism”. Neil shook us all warmly by the throat with some levelling facts about poverty and the inadequate resourcing of primary schools. Neil contrasted, clearly and passionately, the excitement of new potential for education enabled by the technology with the lack of agency in society. He made us see that this is not some abstract, remote poverty suffered by “others” in the world: he showed that it is close to us and that it therefore is our challenge to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two talks were given by two quite different voices, each naïve in their own way: one forgivable, the other, not so much. Laura McGeown, “not a doctor”, student of the Business School and businesswoman, told us a story of student experience. Laura acknowledged that student experience is varied across the university but delivered some important messages about consistency; quality of teaching; and communication. I wondered in Laura’s talk whether all of the concerns she described were within the gift of the University to solve for her, and her talk reminded me of the staff-student liaison discussions I have had over the years at Moray House. That’s not to abdicate responsibility for all she identified: we do indeed, need to listen more to the students and I suggested to Ashley that it was a stroke of genius and a new precedent for all such conferences to have a serious input from our students. The final slot before the University’s CIO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/principals-office/vice-principals-senior-leadership/senior-leadership-team/mclachlan&quot;&gt;Gavin McLachlan&lt;/a&gt;, closed the conference with his summary of the day, was given to Craig Paterson, a communications consultant who presented to us what seems to be the &lt;em&gt;fait accompli&lt;/em&gt; of hybridisation of the future educational provision at the University of Edinburgh. I do hope he was merely speaking &lt;em&gt;ultra vires&lt;/em&gt; and that any suggestion that this is our direction of travel will be subject to wide and critical engagement of the educators within the University. Hybridisation was an expedient response to a particular situation forced upon the university by external factors. That’s a very long way from anyone suggesting that it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-massive-distraction&quot;&gt;A massive distraction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help feeling that this conference was symptomatic of how engaged we have become with the distraction/excuse/opportunity that is COVID-19. Are there pressures on public bodies like the university to take their eyes off the road? The direction of travel remains unprecedented human suffering and exploitation through the abuse of technology. Yet, we are distracted by shiny things like greater scalability and reduced cost-per-student that teachers and technologists have created in response to restrictions on travel and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the IT Futures conference cracked open how dangerous the weaponising of AI and small technologies was becoming. That threat is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2282656-israel-used-worlds-first-ai-guided-combat-drone-swarm-in-gaza-attacks/&quot;&gt;now being realised in theatres of war&lt;/a&gt;, funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://good-with-money.com/2018/06/10/majority-of-uk-pensions-happy-to-invest-in-weapons/&quot;&gt;with our pension money&lt;/a&gt;. Our friends and enemies alike are becoming ever more bold in trying to steal what advantages we may have. To illustrate, my little, almost insignificant development server logs in the past 10 minutes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:note-21-12-10-1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:note-21-12-10-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

It is interesting to notice that the same companies funding the race to mutual obliteration through short-termism and the abdication of any kind of moral (or even logical) constraints on our actions, are the same companies funding lucrative projects around the university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-and-next-steps&quot;&gt;Conclusion and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took from this conference a number of very useful messages not least of which is the reminder that although I think I’m doing OK in terms of my understanding and engagement with the experience of students in my care, there is very likely more that I can be doing. I invite my teacher friends reading this far (thank you!) to join me in reflecting on how to refresh and update our appreciation of the students’ perspective in order to see how we might improve our courses and our teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Writing a literature review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This event is one of many within the PostGraduate Research (PGR) provision at Moray House. It is aimed specifically at first year PGR students. I am thankful to John Kelly for putting this lecture on for us and for fielding Q&amp;amp;A at the end. This was an extremely timely and useful session. These are my own notes from the event – I am responsible for any errors or omissions. &lt;em&gt;Caveat lector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATE/TIME: Tuesday 30 November   [13:00-15:00]
LOCATION: St Leonard’s Land, 3.25
PGR STUDENT GROUP: PGR Students - Year 1
SEMINAR: Writing a literature review
PRESENTER: Dr John Kelly
Director of PG Research
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors in communication delayed the start of this lecture (for it was lecture rather than seminar) which turned out to be not on campus, after all. Delegates quickly sorted out sharing arrangements for laptops as we connected. Others left, presumably to catch the recording later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John quickly offered his disclaimers for the lecture and urged delegates to check in with their supervisors to ensure the approaches they are taking are consistent with the specifics of their project and scope. What followed was presented as general guidance in sections which in practice overlap with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-literature-review&quot;&gt;What is a literature review?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John defined a literature review as a presentation of the literature which provides&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a problem definition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;overview of previous research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ideas on methodology (but don’t overdo this in the literature chapter)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evaluation or critique of existing work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;general conclusions about work done to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the above statements imply “within the specific area of your research project” at the end. Within the Literature Review chapter there will be what John described as “flashing bulbs” which introduce ideas and people that will be significant features in the later chapters of discussion in the thesis. The opportunity exists to raise these ideas or important names in the field within the Literature Review chapter without going too deep – although it is a significant piece of writing it is not meant to dominate: after all, it is about the work that has gone before your research and it is your work that ought to dominate the thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good literature review aids the researcher’s understanding of their subject and also the relationship between your research and the existing literature. John exhorted us all to read widely, to be clear about what’s new in your work, or where gaps exists and how your work fits in to what has gone before. It is a UK requirement that PhDs are new knowledge or findings and so this should be made clear in the thesis. The literature review does this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarising the purpose of the literature review, John quoted from a textbook on sports research methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“By the end of the literature review section in our papers, a reader should not only be able to predict the question driving a study, but clearly understand why someone would ask this question to begin with.”&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Atkinson2012&quot;&gt;(Atkinson, 2012)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning-a-literature-review&quot;&gt;Planning a literature review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although every thesis is different, the literature review component tends to be a single chapter within it. The chapter may address a number of themes, perhaps 4 or 5, and be topped and tailed with a brief introduction and a summary of the key messages. Word estimates may not be at all right for each PhD thesis but might be of the order of 5,000 words per theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the literature review chapter follows immediately on the heels of the thesis introduction chapter, it need not repeat in any detail that which went before but must offer the reader its own introduction or roadmap into the thematic sections, and some signposting out. The methodology chapter often follows the literature review chapter and so the summary of the literature review should provide a “bridge” to methodology that helps situate the literature review in the research. The opening sections of the thesis are thus structured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter 1 Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter 2 Literature Review&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter 3 Methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to constrain at all, nor even tie the PhD researcher to these titles, but this is what the start of a thesis looks like, structurally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how to get started? John used a “bullseye” metaphor to describe how the literature search relates to your topic. In describing the literature in your thesis, you might begin with a broad scope and progress towards the narrower focus of your very specific niche: the gap you are filling my well be very niche indeed, for so much has been been done before. Not everything! That’s why you’re doing this PhD. However, in getting started in on the literature search and the reading that goes with it, you are going to begin at the bullseye and construct search terms that are highly specific, revealing from “hits” that include all of your terms, published material very close to your specific interest. From here, you work out through layers of relevance, sketching out themes and names that you can describe and set up (see “flashing bulbs” above) in your thorough review of what has gone before and where it came from. This needs to be thorough, keep going and become the expert on the topic of your research and the fields and branches that it is part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reading all of this material, there are some specific things to pay attention to. First, some questions as you read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what methods were used?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what data did they collect?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what choices did they have to make and how did they make those choices?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what data collections techniques did they use and are they relevant to your own research?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These relate to learning about how others before have worked, and perhaps how things might be done in your own project. You are not going to be passive in your reading, however, at this level you are expected to be critically engaged in evaluating the literature you find. More questions to ask as you read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who wrote it and who/how was it reviewed before publication?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who cites this piece?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how recent is it and has it been overtaken by newer literature?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how relevant is it to your project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers to these questions will help you see how they did it – what structure they used, how they wrote it, how they designed their research, what analysis methods were used and even how they chose to report their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-here&quot;&gt;Start here&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your way in to all of this is in developing a basic understanding of the themes in your project (remember, this lecture was aimed at first year PGR students, mostly PhD students only a few weeks in to their PhDs, me included). This basic understanding can be had by first of all engaging with textbooks – often the first 4 – 5 chapters of the key texts in your domain will address the main themes. Once you have some confidence in your basic knowledge, then you can begin to go deeper by finding relevant journal articles by searching databases using keywords of concepts. Start with selecting your keywords, then pair them up. Combining more and more terms will lead you back towards the “bullseye” of your area of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrowing scope by combining keywords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-a-literature-review&quot;&gt;Writing a literature review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your finished literature review needs to be a coherent and integrated account of what exists in the literature but don’t be a leave to structure, especially early on. Allow the structure to emerge organically as you read and capture “thesisable prose” in your notes. These notes are going to integrate the findings in the literature you read, in other words, you are going to highlight similarities across the literature that emerge from your reading, as well as agreements (or disagreements). The whole point of this is to enable you to identify the place where your research fits in – how it adds new knowledge or extends understanding in the literature, or fills the gaps that are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure includes connecting sections that follow the main thesis introduction and lead out to your methodology, with the main findings in the existing literature as the bulk of the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cautions-and-tips&quot;&gt;Cautions and tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John briefly spoke about weak literature reviews which may be bland, or that list unconnected summaries. The Literature Review chapter in your thesis does not stand alone, it sets out the key themes that your discussion chapters will link back to, addressing the gap you have identified. It’s not “fire and forget”, either, and should be kept fresh throughout your PhD project as you keep your finger on the new papers that emerge in your field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practical tips included being clear about the scope of the information you are using: books are good for breadth, whereas journal articles are good for reliability and depth (because of the review process). The internet, as we all know, has no quality control. Anyone can publish anything they like on the internet (this present article being a case in point). Avoid the “shopping basket” approach to collecting great lists of references: the number of references cited is not proportional to the quality of your literature review. Be selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top tips also include seeing how others have done it before you in your specific area. This comes from your reading but with a warning: don’t become paralysed by what’s out there already, nor seduced by what other people are doing that it distracts you from your own vision. I am fortunate in that the very first thing my supervisors did, was to have me write down that vision with a sketch plan of how I am going to do it. Formulating that vision for the project has been extremely powerful and has enabled me to be able confidently to talk to others about my project. I can state clearly what the exact point of my research is: John suggested that when PGR students can’t do this, it is because of a poor literature review. That made me feel particularly good about where I am on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Survive and Thrive as a Part Time PhD Researcher</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from another excellent online course provided by the University’s IAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-course-actions&quot;&gt;Pre course Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were asked, about a week before the course, to read an article in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/27/how-to-juggle-a-full-time-job-and-a-part-time-phd&quot;&gt;online Grauniad&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;How to juggle a full-time job and a part-time PhD&lt;/em&gt;; to think of &lt;em&gt;5 top tips&lt;/em&gt; for being successful as a PT PhD; and bring questions of our own to the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the correspondence were also buried a couple of unannounced pdf attachments which contained resource for the course, I think, but also some links to blog posts and articles&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on doing a part-time PhD. One message stood out from these, beyond those that resonated with my own “top tips” (below), and that was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;students who study part time for their whole degree finish sooner and have better results than full time students.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-pearson&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-pearson&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, that is encouraging. I have a hope not to overrun on my own PhD, and finish early if at all possible but there are a lot of factors in that particular critical path, most of which I have no idea about. For now, I am focusing on sustaining the momentum by doing something every day, unless I specifically plan not to. It’s working so far, and I have managed when external factors have confounded that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a TBR (to be read) list is a good idea: I have one but it’s huge and diverse. Next task is to organise and prioritise that. Lastly from the blogs, making use of buffer time that provides transition space between work, home and study. My job is closely related to my research and there is a “double divided” of much of the studying/thinking I am doing, so it matters less between work and study time, but I also need to be sure to be fully present at home: to not be nodding along to a domestic tale whilst mentally drafting some thesisable nugget. Working memory needs to be dedicated to whatever is current or in the moment. &lt;strong&gt;Multitasking is your enemy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-5-top-tips&quot;&gt;My 5 top tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Block out time&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;You have to switch off everything that might distract you from your PhD. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt;. The only way I have been able to do that is block out time when I am doing nothing else but PhD work.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Have specific objectives&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;That time should be spent working on something specific, whether tidying up your reference manager library, reading specific papers, searching for new ones or writing up notes.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Track achievement&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Have a to-do list that you check in on every day and check off the things you complete or progress. Watching that build into a record of achievement helps keep me keep moving forward.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Talk about your research&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I find it feels good to talk to other people about my research project. It is important and interesting, what you are doing. Tell people about it and what impact you hope to achieve. If you haven’t got people, talk to a dog. Or a gonk.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Accept advice gracefully, and park it&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;When you talk to other people, they may well have their own ideas or a book/paper/journal for you to read. Keep track of that stuff but sustain your immediate direction – don’t be distracted by what others think you should be reading. Make time for it when you can to check back on once you have progressed what you’re working on &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-seminar&quot;&gt;The seminar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 90-minute seminar was led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hutchinsontraining.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Hutchinson&lt;/a&gt; who I have met before on a speed-reading course. He’s an impressive teacher, whether in the 2-D Zoom space or 3-D in real life, where he is a pretty impressive sketch noter. I still have his notes from that on my office wall: and still use the methods he taught me. Delegates were grouped for chatting about what works and what doesn’t: based on our preparatory notes and conversations between us. As well as my top five above, there were some superb ideas to help, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing is output, even if it’s shit;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you stop writing, note down prompts for next time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get some time in early, before looking at your emails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t compare yourself with other people (especially full-timers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;focusing in small chunks of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to keep yourself reminded of why your PhD is important to you: what motivates you about it and the things you are learning. The vision involves “bricks, walls, and cathedrals”: the to-do list is the day to day reification of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The PhD is a project to be managed, not a quest for truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of other ideas and strategies shared, reference within the course handout, that make it a useful reference to return to, especially when it might get sticky. Of greatest importance is the repeated reminder that &lt;strong&gt;the purpose is to pass&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was absolutely well worth doing: both the preparation, the thinking, and also the engagement with the seminar. The delegates connected in a really lovely way, all fully supportive and empathic. I am thankful to them, and to Steve, and to the IAD for this course.&lt;/p&gt;

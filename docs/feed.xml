        <title>Chicago author-date with ibid</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my supervisors recently suggested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Just a stylistic thing going forward, but where you have recently cited the same author, you can use Ibid (e.g. (Ibid: 2) or similar), rather than include their names again”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great advice and something I had seen before. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/DOWNLOAD-DESKTOP/&quot;&gt;Mendeley Desktop&lt;/a&gt; as my academic library and reference manager, which plays nicely with my &lt;a href=&quot;/phd-workflow-22&quot;&gt;writing workflow&lt;/a&gt;. I am used to using the so-called “Harvard” citation style, otherwise known as “author-date” because it looks like this: &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#bresson1999the&quot;&gt;(Cartier-Bresson, 1999)&lt;/a&gt; but had not worked out how to have the software automatically detect when &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt; is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to it is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://citationstyles.org/&quot;&gt;citation style&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file that tells your typesetting program how to format citations. There are thousands of these, publicly accessible over at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/styles&quot;&gt;Zotero Style Repository&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to use a popular &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;csl&lt;/code&gt; style using the globally recognised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/&quot;&gt;Chicago Style Manual&lt;/a&gt; but the use of &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt; has been deprecated there. They favour the use of a short form citation which is well suited to the numbered footnote alternative to author-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little leg work I found that it is quite easy to adapt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-author-date&quot;&gt;the current Chicago author-date&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file to include the &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt; feature from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-with-ibid&quot;&gt;its numbered footnote sister&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-adaptation&quot;&gt;The adaptation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with a copy of the author-date &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file (obviously change the name), find the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;citation&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag and merge the equivalent code from the fullnote with ibid &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file. It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;citation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;et-al-min=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;et-al-use-first=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disambiguate-add-year-suffix=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disambiguate-add-names=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disambiguate-add-givenname=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;givenname-disambiguation-rule=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;primary-name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collapse=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;year&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;after-collapse-delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;prefix=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;(&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;suffix=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;choose&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;position=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid-with-locator&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;term=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;point-locators-subsequent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/group&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/if&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;else-if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;position=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;term=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ibid&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/else-if&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;else&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;delimiter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;contributors-short&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;date-in-text&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;macro=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;point-locators&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/group&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/else&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/choose&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/group&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/layout&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/citation&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also necessary to pull in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;point-locators-subsequent&lt;/code&gt; macro. Paste it below the other macros in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is required now is to point the rendering software to the style file, in my case, by editing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; header in my markdown document, or the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file for this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel that I should push this back to the open source repositories because it’s just my own hack that works for me, but you can download my version of &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/docs/chicago-author-date-with-ibid.csl&quot;&gt;chicago-author-date-with-ibid.csl&lt;/a&gt; to adapt for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;bibliography&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;bresson1999the&quot;&gt;Cartier-Bresson, Henri. 1999. &lt;i&gt;The Mind’s Eye : Writings on Photography and Photographers&lt;/i&gt;. New York, N.Y: Aperture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>PhD Tools and software</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I responded to a Twitter conversation about software used to write a thesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Markdown, Pandoc to pdf with Mendeley. I edit in VSCode, and config manage using GitHub. If anyone at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MorayHouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@MorayHouse&lt;/a&gt; wants a demo/tutorial, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nick Hood (@cullaloe) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cullaloe/status/1494320531436228613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Christina_Mik&quot;&gt;@Christina_Mik&lt;/a&gt; asked for a demo, which I am happy to do in person but haven’t the time to make a video of. What I have done instead is to adapt notes from the online thesis to describe the workflow and tools I am using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;platform&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try as much as possible to eliminate duplication of both effort and data and have learned that text-based files free me from the tyranny of proprietary idiosyncracies. All of what follows can be achieved on pretty much any modern computing platform: Windows, Linux, whatever. The main platform I use is a MacBook Air running macOS Big Sur 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workflow&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have three kinds of document to produce. The first kind are short, maybe only one to a few pages, or a presentation file, usually in the form of a printable pdf. Next, are the public articles such as the one you are reading. Finally, there are extended works which should be kept private but sharable until they are ready, like a thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all three kinds of document, I use plain text files which are readable across many platforms, and which are easily backed up and managed. I absolutely do not care about formatting whilst I am writing, it is just a distraction: I can get a machine to make it pretty when I am ready to publish or share. Here is a graphic of my writing workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mermaid&quot;&gt;
graph TD
    subgraph Literature
    A([Reading])--&amp;gt;B[Citation &amp;amp; References]--&amp;gt;C[/Mendeley Desktop/]--&amp;gt;E(Bibtex file)
    B--&amp;gt;D[/Mendeley Web Importer/]--&amp;gt;DD--&amp;gt;C
    C--&amp;gt;DD[(Mendeley library)]
    end
    subgraph Writing
    A--&amp;gt;F([Thinking and analysis])--&amp;gt;G(Writing)--&amp;gt;H[/Visual Studio Code or MacDown /]--&amp;gt;X(Markdown text file)
    X--&amp;gt;L[(GitHub repository)]--&amp;gt;X
    end
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the net output is in two files: the &lt;strong&gt;markdown text file&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;bibtex file&lt;/strong&gt; containing all of the sources I have cited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;citation-and-referencing&quot;&gt;Citation and referencing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/&quot;&gt;Mendeley&lt;/a&gt; is a reference manager suite that includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/mendeley-desktop&quot;&gt;desktop application&lt;/a&gt; to access and manage your own library of references, and generates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibtex.org/&quot;&gt;bibtex&lt;/a&gt; files which can be used by text processors. Note that the desktop application is not being supported now: there is a newer and much less useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendeley.com/download-reference-manager&quot;&gt;Mendeley Reference Manager&lt;/a&gt;. Many users have been lobbying Elsevier, who own Mendeley, to reinstate the Mendeley Desktop app or add its functionality to the new Reference Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most useful feature of Mendeley Desktop, apart from importing and managing my reference library, is the automatic creation and update of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file of the entire library, or optionally, separate bib files for each folder. The bib file is used by \(\LaTeX\) and pandoc when generating your document output, to insert correctly formatted citations and your bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;document-production&quot;&gt;Document production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my documents are written in some form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For writing casual or stand-alone documents (reports, presentations, articles), I may use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://macdown.uranusjr.com/&quot;&gt;Macdown&lt;/a&gt; open source Markdown editor for macOS, but more often there are several documents “on the go” at once within the same folder, when I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; IDE &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wssat&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wssat&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; easiest to use for editing. It can be used to edit csv &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wassat2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wassat2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; files with &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/janisdd&quot;&gt;Janis DD&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv&quot;&gt;Edit CSV&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a visual of how the three types of document are produced from the markdown source file and the bibtex file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mermaid&quot;&gt;

    end
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stand-alone-documents&quot;&gt;Stand-alone documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; is used to generate stand-alone documents from markdown source with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc&quot;&gt;pandoc-citeproc&lt;/a&gt; taking care of linking to bibliographies. Diagrams in these documents (like the graphics in this post) are produced using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raghur/mermaid-filter&quot;&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt; filter for pandoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents written in markdown often include a short &lt;a href=&quot;https://yaml.org/&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; header containing information about it and instructions for pandoc, etc. Here is an example markdown document, with a YAML header:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;My amazing document&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Nick Hood&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bibliography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/path/to/your/library.bib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;\today&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;gh&quot;&gt;# My heading&lt;/span&gt;
Here is some text which is very interesting. Here is some text which is very interesting. Here is some text which is very interesting. Here is some text which is very interesting. Here is some text which is very interesting.

&lt;span class=&quot;gu&quot;&gt;## A subheading&lt;/span&gt;
Here is some text which is very interesting but more detailed. Here is some text which is very interesting but more detailed. Here is some text which is very interesting but more detailed. Here is some text which is very interesting but more detailed. Here is some text which is very interesting but more detailed. 

&lt;span class=&quot;gu&quot;&gt;## A paragraph with a reference in it&lt;/span&gt;
Here is some text which is my interpretation of what someone else wrote about [@OxfordEnglishDictionary]. 

&lt;span class=&quot;gh&quot;&gt;# References&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a pdf of this document using pandoc, we type this in a terminal window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pandoc &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; filename.md &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; filename.pdf &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--citeproc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It produces &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/docs/filename.pdf&quot;&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extended-documents-not-public-eg-thesis&quot;&gt;Extended documents, not public (e.g. Thesis)&lt;/h3&gt;

My (non-public) thesis website is made using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookdown.org/&quot;&gt;Bookdown&lt;/a&gt; R package &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Xie2016&quot;&gt;(Xie, 2016; Xie, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, which itself uses pandoc to generate HTML, Word and pdf documents.

&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which renders files uploaded and hosted there. It is possible to have GitHub use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; but I prefer to build the pages on my local machine and have GitHub render static HTML. I have found this to be more stable and less prone to attack. Read more about that &lt;a href=&quot;/jekyll-update-via-rake&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;deploy-jekyll-site-from-github&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not related to general projects but certainly useful in mine is the ability to capture for my own use, BBC radio programmes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer&quot;&gt;get_iPlayer&lt;/a&gt; is a command-line programme written in Perl which downloads TV and radio programmes from BBC iPlayer/BBC Sounds &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#notnac2021&quot;&gt;(“Get-Iplayer/get_iplayer,” 2021)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source documents and data files, all in text format, are retained in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NixImagery&quot;&gt;GitHub private repository&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does that mean that everything is backed up against loss or damage to a computer, it is also protected against me: I can roll back changes if I need to, or launch my computer off a cliff without losing my work. Not likely, but you wear a seat belt, don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IT Futures Conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: these are notes from my own perceptions and any errors of understanding are my personal responsibility. &lt;em&gt;Caveat lector.&lt;/em&gt; The sketches are for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of the 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itfutures.ed.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;IT Futures Conference&lt;/a&gt; was “Hybrid and other teaching changes in a Post-COVID world.” The conference has missed a year for well-kent reasons and returned as an experiment in hybrid conferencing. Delegates could register for in-person attendance at the superb McEwan Hall or participate digitally. I chose to attend in person because for me, it is the bits in between the formal sessions that make a good conference and I hoped for that serendipity found in these places. I wasn’t disappointed and had some inspiring, challenging and rich conversations with those delegates and presenters I spoke to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;morning-sessions&quot;&gt;Morning sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference, as in 2019, was opened by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/principals-office/principal-biography&quot;&gt;Prof. Peter Mathieson&lt;/a&gt; who suggested that we might be in for a 10-year ride on the COVID-19 rollercoaster, laying down the first wash of assumptions that would pervade many of the messages from the conference about the hybridisation of university teaching. We are to assume hybrid, or at least, digital first perhaps as we expect campus life to modernise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9542.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Siân and Ben&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/sian-bayne&quot;&gt;Prof. Siân Bayne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/ben-williamson&quot;&gt;Dr. Ben Williamson&lt;/a&gt; presented a picture of the future of universities using a structure of &lt;em&gt;Modes, Frictions, and Futures&lt;/em&gt;. Siân began with Modes, describing the evolution of the university from &lt;em&gt;Elite&lt;/em&gt;, “Ivory Tower” places which may be accessed by only the privileged few of society; &lt;em&gt;Mass&lt;/em&gt; mode places of learning and research using a “Factory or Entrepreneur” image to relate their purpose and population; and finally, the &lt;em&gt;Universal&lt;/em&gt; mode, characterised as “Networked” or “Ecological”.  Siân asked, “where are we now?” on this journey, highlighting perhaps, Ben’s first of five controversies or frictions, that of &lt;em&gt;Fictional Futures&lt;/em&gt;, which are proposed and expected by technology, investors and consultancy businesses and all of which drive towards further exploitations; the fictional expectations of such proposals are intended to produce certainty, to anaesthetise those who might question these expectations. Ben’s use of scare quotes when highlighting the phrase “digital transformation” in the corporate materials promoting these fictional futures, was hilarious. Recently this tech domination of education has become exacerbated by mergers and the creation of monopolies in certain spaces in education technology. Ben cited the example of the merger of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005749/en/Anthology-and-Blackboard-to-Merge-Creating-a-Leading-Global-Provider-of-Education-Software-and-Solutions&quot;&gt;Anthology and Blackboard&lt;/a&gt;. The other three frictions were Educational Technology/Eco Futures; the automation of education in platforms like Coursera; and “Cloud campuses” and the dominance of AWS in the provision of large elements of education infrastructure. The last part of this session was around &lt;em&gt;Futures&lt;/em&gt; and prompted a lively Q&amp;amp;A session which expressed the alarm felt in places about the corporate dominance of a few enterprises; the potential of open source to push back against this; and the weakness of claims that hybridisation is either cheaper or more ecologically superior to more traditional models of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-colm-harmon&quot;&gt;Prof. Colm Harmon&lt;/a&gt; considered what might be expected by way of student experience in the next few years. He celebrated the achievements the university has made in the past two years in relation to the digital provision and claimed that we’re good at it. &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9546.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Rhona&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctl.ox.ac.uk/people/rhona-sharpe&quot;&gt;Prof. Rhona Sharpe&lt;/a&gt;’s lively and interactive session asked what we might carry forward in our teaching practice from our experience of hybridisation. She described the changes in policy at Oxford which have emerged from the dialogue that they (as everyone else in teaching in FE/HE) have had with students during the time of rapid change. What they discovered, interestingly, and which was referred to in a number of discussions today, was that which any decent primary or secondary teacher has known for their entire careers. These professional educators (cf. someone who assumes that they can teach merely because they know about their subject) have always known that good teaching begins and ends with the pupil. It has taken the pandemic to make many institutions turn around and speak seriously to their students: the incredible discoveries made by Oxford and Edinburgh include things like the importance of mental health. The importance of recognising the diversity of cultures, contexts and needs amongst not only the students but also the tutors, the technicians and the servitors, all of them involved and deeply committed to making the world better the only way we know, that is, the development and growth of its people. Those of use who teach at Moray House have known this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If the needs of the disabled students are met, then the needs of all students are met.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote from Rhona’s presentation struck me particularly as an illustration of the stance taken by those who have noticed their disabled students – by which I mean those who are slightly different in some way from the median – recognising that diversity is the norm and the acceptance, celebration and exploitation of that diversity is what ought to be at the heart of any future of education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;afternoon-sessions&quot;&gt;Afternoon sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief summary of the “meet the speaker” sessions, the afternoon’s sessions were more showcase and discussion on innovation taking place now in the university, not just in response (reaction?) to the pandemic. &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_9545.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/staff/ashley-lloyd&quot;&gt;Dr. Ashley Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; of the Business School told the story of the development of one of his courses under the title of “pivoting a large class and teaching team”, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-timothy-drysdale&quot;&gt;Prof. Tim Drysdale&lt;/a&gt; showed off his remote access practical labs at &lt;a href=&quot;https://practable.io/&quot;&gt;practable.io&lt;/a&gt;. I had a play with a simple harmonic activity on this system and it’s pretty good – most definitely a better experience than the ubiquitous online simulations found in every hybrid physics or engineering course. There’s nothing like the real thing, of course, but I found this to be significantly superior to HTML5 animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further presentations from IAD’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/about-us/staff/profiles/celeste-mclaughlin&quot;&gt;Celeste McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; and other course leaders around the university took place within the after-space of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-neil-m-speirs&quot;&gt;Dr. Neil Spiers&lt;/a&gt;’ superb challenge to what he called “digital triumphalism”. Neil shook us all warmly by the throat with some levelling facts about poverty and the inadequate resourcing of primary schools. Neil contrasted, clearly and passionately, the excitement of new potential for education enabled by the technology with the lack of agency in society. He made us see that this is not some abstract, remote poverty suffered by “others” in the world: he showed that it is close to us and that it therefore is our challenge to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two talks were given by two quite different voices, each naïve in their own way: one forgivable, the other, not so much. Laura McGeown, “not a doctor”, student of the Business School and businesswoman, told us a story of student experience. Laura acknowledged that student experience is varied across the university but delivered some important messages about consistency; quality of teaching; and communication. I wondered in Laura’s talk whether all of the concerns she described were within the gift of the University to solve for her, and her talk reminded me of the staff-student liaison discussions I have had over the years at Moray House. That’s not to abdicate responsibility for all she identified: we do indeed, need to listen more to the students and I suggested to Ashley that it was a stroke of genius and a new precedent for all such conferences to have a serious input from our students. The final slot before the University’s CIO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/principals-office/vice-principals-senior-leadership/senior-leadership-team/mclachlan&quot;&gt;Gavin McLachlan&lt;/a&gt;, closed the conference with his summary of the day, was given to Craig Paterson, a communications consultant who presented to us what seems to be the &lt;em&gt;fait accompli&lt;/em&gt; of hybridisation of the future educational provision at the University of Edinburgh. I do hope he was merely speaking &lt;em&gt;ultra vires&lt;/em&gt; and that any suggestion that this is our direction of travel will be subject to wide and critical engagement of the educators within the University. Hybridisation was an expedient response to a particular situation forced upon the university by external factors. That’s a very long way from anyone suggesting that it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-massive-distraction&quot;&gt;A massive distraction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help feeling that this conference was symptomatic of how engaged we have become with the distraction/excuse/opportunity that is COVID-19. Are there pressures on public bodies like the university to take their eyes off the road? The direction of travel remains unprecedented human suffering and exploitation through the abuse of technology. Yet, we are distracted by shiny things like greater scalability and reduced cost-per-student that teachers and technologists have created in response to restrictions on travel and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the IT Futures conference cracked open how dangerous the weaponising of AI and small technologies was becoming. That threat is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2282656-israel-used-worlds-first-ai-guided-combat-drone-swarm-in-gaza-attacks/&quot;&gt;now being realised in theatres of war&lt;/a&gt;, funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://good-with-money.com/2018/06/10/majority-of-uk-pensions-happy-to-invest-in-weapons/&quot;&gt;with our pension money&lt;/a&gt;. Our friends and enemies alike are becoming ever more bold in trying to steal what advantages we may have. To illustrate, my little, almost insignificant development server logs in the past 10 minutes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:note-21-12-10-1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:note-21-12-10-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

It is interesting to notice that the same companies funding the race to mutual obliteration through short-termism and the abdication of any kind of moral (or even logical) constraints on our actions, are the same companies funding lucrative projects around the university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-and-next-steps&quot;&gt;Conclusion and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took from this conference a number of very useful messages not least of which is the reminder that although I think I’m doing OK in terms of my understanding and engagement with the experience of students in my care, there is very likely more that I can be doing. I invite my teacher friends reading this far (thank you!) to join me in reflecting on how to refresh and update our appreciation of the students’ perspective in order to see how we might improve our courses and our teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Writing a literature review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This event is one of many within the PostGraduate Research (PGR) provision at Moray House. It is aimed specifically at first year PGR students. I am thankful to John Kelly for putting this lecture on for us and for fielding Q&amp;amp;A at the end. This was an extremely timely and useful session. These are my own notes from the event – I am responsible for any errors or omissions. &lt;em&gt;Caveat lector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATE/TIME: Tuesday 30 November   [13:00-15:00]
LOCATION: St Leonard’s Land, 3.25
PGR STUDENT GROUP: PGR Students - Year 1
SEMINAR: Writing a literature review
PRESENTER: Dr John Kelly
Director of PG Research
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors in communication delayed the start of this lecture (for it was lecture rather than seminar) which turned out to be not on campus, after all. Delegates quickly sorted out sharing arrangements for laptops as we connected. Others left, presumably to catch the recording later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John quickly offered his disclaimers for the lecture and urged delegates to check in with their supervisors to ensure the approaches they are taking are consistent with the specifics of their project and scope. What followed was presented as general guidance in sections which in practice overlap with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-literature-review&quot;&gt;What is a literature review?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John defined a literature review as a presentation of the literature which provides&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a problem definition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;overview of previous research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ideas on methodology (but don’t overdo this in the literature chapter)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evaluation or critique of existing work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;general conclusions about work done to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the above statements imply “within the specific area of your research project” at the end. Within the Literature Review chapter there will be what John described as “flashing bulbs” which introduce ideas and people that will be significant features in the later chapters of discussion in the thesis. The opportunity exists to raise these ideas or important names in the field within the Literature Review chapter without going too deep – although it is a significant piece of writing it is not meant to dominate: after all, it is about the work that has gone before your research and it is your work that ought to dominate the thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good literature review aids the researcher’s understanding of their subject and also the relationship between your research and the existing literature. John exhorted us all to read widely, to be clear about what’s new in your work, or where gaps exists and how your work fits in to what has gone before. It is a UK requirement that PhDs are new knowledge or findings and so this should be made clear in the thesis. The literature review does this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarising the purpose of the literature review, John quoted from a textbook on sports research methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“By the end of the literature review section in our papers, a reader should not only be able to predict the question driving a study, but clearly understand why someone would ask this question to begin with.”&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Atkinson2012&quot;&gt;(Atkinson, 2012)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning-a-literature-review&quot;&gt;Planning a literature review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although every thesis is different, the literature review component tends to be a single chapter within it. The chapter may address a number of themes, perhaps 4 or 5, and be topped and tailed with a brief introduction and a summary of the key messages. Word estimates may not be at all right for each PhD thesis but might be of the order of 5,000 words per theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the literature review chapter follows immediately on the heels of the thesis introduction chapter, it need not repeat in any detail that which went before but must offer the reader its own introduction or roadmap into the thematic sections, and some signposting out. The methodology chapter often follows the literature review chapter and so the summary of the literature review should provide a “bridge” to methodology that helps situate the literature review in the research. The opening sections of the thesis are thus structured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter 1 Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter 2 Literature Review&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter 3 Methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to constrain at all, nor even tie the PhD researcher to these titles, but this is what the start of a thesis looks like, structurally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how to get started? John used a “bullseye” metaphor to describe how the literature search relates to your topic. In describing the literature in your thesis, you might begin with a broad scope and progress towards the narrower focus of your very specific niche: the gap you are filling my well be very niche indeed, for so much has been been done before. Not everything! That’s why you’re doing this PhD. However, in getting started in on the literature search and the reading that goes with it, you are going to begin at the bullseye and construct search terms that are highly specific, revealing from “hits” that include all of your terms, published material very close to your specific interest. From here, you work out through layers of relevance, sketching out themes and names that you can describe and set up (see “flashing bulbs” above) in your thorough review of what has gone before and where it came from. This needs to be thorough, keep going and become the expert on the topic of your research and the fields and branches that it is part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reading all of this material, there are some specific things to pay attention to. First, some questions as you read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what methods were used?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what data did they collect?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what choices did they have to make and how did they make those choices?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what data collections techniques did they use and are they relevant to your own research?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These relate to learning about how others before have worked, and perhaps how things might be done in your own project. You are not going to be passive in your reading, however, at this level you are expected to be critically engaged in evaluating the literature you find. More questions to ask as you read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who wrote it and who/how was it reviewed before publication?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who cites this piece?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how recent is it and has it been overtaken by newer literature?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how relevant is it to your project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers to these questions will help you see how they did it – what structure they used, how they wrote it, how they designed their research, what analysis methods were used and even how they chose to report their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-here&quot;&gt;Start here&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your way in to all of this is in developing a basic understanding of the themes in your project (remember, this lecture was aimed at first year PGR students, mostly PhD students only a few weeks in to their PhDs, me included). This basic understanding can be had by first of all engaging with textbooks – often the first 4 – 5 chapters of the key texts in your domain will address the main themes. Once you have some confidence in your basic knowledge, then you can begin to go deeper by finding relevant journal articles by searching databases using keywords of concepts. Start with selecting your keywords, then pair them up. Combining more and more terms will lead you back towards the “bullseye” of your area of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;EDUCATION

TEACHER EDUCATION UNDERGRADUATE UK
SECONDARY TEACHER EDUCATION UNDERGRADUATE UK
SECONDARY PHYSICS TEACHER EDUCATION UNDERGRADUATE UK

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrowing scope by combining keywords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-a-literature-review&quot;&gt;Writing a literature review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your finished literature review needs to be a coherent and integrated account of what exists in the literature but don’t be a leave to structure, especially early on. Allow the structure to emerge organically as you read and capture “thesisable prose” in your notes. These notes are going to integrate the findings in the literature you read, in other words, you are going to highlight similarities across the literature that emerge from your reading, as well as agreements (or disagreements). The whole point of this is to enable you to identify the place where your research fits in – how it adds new knowledge or extends understanding in the literature, or fills the gaps that are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure includes connecting sections that follow the main thesis introduction and lead out to your methodology, with the main findings in the existing literature as the bulk of the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cautions-and-tips&quot;&gt;Cautions and tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John briefly spoke about weak literature reviews which may be bland, or that list unconnected summaries. The Literature Review chapter in your thesis does not stand alone, it sets out the key themes that your discussion chapters will link back to, addressing the gap you have identified. It’s not “fire and forget”, either, and should be kept fresh throughout your PhD project as you keep your finger on the new papers that emerge in your field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practical tips included being clear about the scope of the information you are using: books are good for breadth, whereas journal articles are good for reliability and depth (because of the review process). The internet, as we all know, has no quality control. Anyone can publish anything they like on the internet (this present article being a case in point). Avoid the “shopping basket” approach to collecting great lists of references: the number of references cited is not proportional to the quality of your literature review. Be selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top tips also include seeing how others have done it before you in your specific area. This comes from your reading but with a warning: don’t become paralysed by what’s out there already, nor seduced by what other people are doing that it distracts you from your own vision. I am fortunate in that the very first thing my supervisors did, was to have me write down that vision with a sketch plan of how I am going to do it. Formulating that vision for the project has been extremely powerful and has enabled me to be able confidently to talk to others about my project. I can state clearly what the exact point of my research is: John suggested that when PGR students can’t do this, it is because of a poor literature review. That made me feel particularly good about where I am on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Survive and Thrive as a Part Time PhD Researcher</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from another excellent online course provided by the University’s IAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-course-actions&quot;&gt;Pre course Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were asked, about a week before the course, to read an article in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/27/how-to-juggle-a-full-time-job-and-a-part-time-phd&quot;&gt;online Grauniad&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;How to juggle a full-time job and a part-time PhD&lt;/em&gt;; to think of &lt;em&gt;5 top tips&lt;/em&gt; for being successful as a PT PhD; and bring questions of our own to the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the correspondence were also buried a couple of unannounced pdf attachments which contained resource for the course, I think, but also some links to blog posts and articles&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-blog4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-blog4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on doing a part-time PhD. One message stood out from these, beyond those that resonated with my own “top tips” (below), and that was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;students who study part time for their whole degree finish sooner and have better results than full time students.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2021-11-10-pearson&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2021-11-10-pearson&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, that is encouraging. I have a hope not to overrun on my own PhD, and finish early if at all possible but there are a lot of factors in that particular critical path, most of which I have no idea about. For now, I am focusing on sustaining the momentum by doing something every day, unless I specifically plan not to. It’s working so far, and I have managed when external factors have confounded that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a TBR (to be read) list is a good idea: I have one but it’s huge and diverse. Next task is to organise and prioritise that. Lastly from the blogs, making use of buffer time that provides transition space between work, home and study. My job is closely related to my research and there is a “double divided” of much of the studying/thinking I am doing, so it matters less between work and study time, but I also need to be sure to be fully present at home: to not be nodding along to a domestic tale whilst mentally drafting some thesisable nugget. Working memory needs to be dedicated to whatever is current or in the moment. &lt;strong&gt;Multitasking is your enemy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-5-top-tips&quot;&gt;My 5 top tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Block out time&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;You have to switch off everything that might distract you from your PhD. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt;. The only way I have been able to do that is block out time when I am doing nothing else but PhD work.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Have specific objectives&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;That time should be spent working on something specific, whether tidying up your reference manager library, reading specific papers, searching for new ones or writing up notes.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Track achievement&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Have a to-do list that you check in on every day and check off the things you complete or progress. Watching that build into a record of achievement helps keep me keep moving forward.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Talk about your research&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I find it feels good to talk to other people about my research project. It is important and interesting, what you are doing. Tell people about it and what impact you hope to achieve. If you haven’t got people, talk to a dog. Or a gonk.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Accept advice gracefully, and park it&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;When you talk to other people, they may well have their own ideas or a book/paper/journal for you to read. Keep track of that stuff but sustain your immediate direction – don’t be distracted by what others think you should be reading. Make time for it when you can to check back on once you have progressed what you’re working on &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-seminar&quot;&gt;The seminar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 90-minute seminar was led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hutchinsontraining.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Hutchinson&lt;/a&gt; who I have met before on a speed-reading course. He’s an impressive teacher, whether in the 2-D Zoom space or 3-D in real life, where he is a pretty impressive sketch noter. I still have his notes from that on my office wall: and still use the methods he taught me. Delegates were grouped for chatting about what works and what doesn’t: based on our preparatory notes and conversations between us. As well as my top five above, there were some superb ideas to help, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing is output, even if it’s shit;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you stop writing, note down prompts for next time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get some time in early, before looking at your emails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t compare yourself with other people (especially full-timers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;focusing in small chunks of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to keep yourself reminded of why your PhD is important to you: what motivates you about it and the things you are learning. The vision involves “bricks, walls, and cathedrals”: the to-do list is the day to day reification of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The PhD is a project to be managed, not a quest for truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of other ideas and strategies shared, reference within the course handout, that make it a useful reference to return to, especially when it might get sticky. Of greatest importance is the repeated reminder that &lt;strong&gt;the purpose is to pass&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was absolutely well worth doing: both the preparation, the thinking, and also the engagement with the seminar. The delegates connected in a really lovely way, all fully supportive and empathic. I am thankful to them, and to Steve, and to the IAD for this course.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>(First part of) LibSmart II</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a modular course to support Masters and PGR students in using the library effectively. It follows on from LibSmart I, the foundational course on using the library for all students. A diagnostic quiz enables selection of the right modules from the course based upon your answers to questions about your area of interest. The module titles do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;module-1-literature-searching-for-systematic-reviews&quot;&gt;Module 1: Literature Searching for Systematic Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module contains an extremely useful video best watched early in the day, after your first coffee, when you’re still perky. What it does is clearly set &lt;em&gt;systematic review&lt;/em&gt; within a context of the different kinds of literature review: it is the most “scientific” of the review methods, requiring a narrow scope, highly defined and reproducible protocols or procedures, and often conducted by teams of researchers. A principle of these reviews is that they are transparent, and reproducible if the same protocols are followed. The &lt;em&gt;protocols&lt;/em&gt; of systematic review include the rationale, the objectives and the methods used to conduct it. These form part of the published output such that another team can follow them and reach the same conclusions. Objectivity and the mitigation of bias are key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another type of review described in the video is the &lt;em&gt;scoping review&lt;/em&gt;, which may precede a systematic review as a first stage. It describes what has been done in and around an area of interest. The &lt;em&gt;historical review&lt;/em&gt;  is more narrow in focus on the topic but serves to summarise or introduce it, rather like a lecture or keynote. This kind of review is selective and illustrative and so two such reviews may disagree according to the views of the reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final kind of review is the one I am interested in, that which appears as a chapter in a thesis. It is designed to contextualise the thesis within prior work in the area, to justify the research perhaps by locating the gaps it addresses. It is selective and based upon iterative search in separate related topics within the theme of the thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t pursue the rest of the module and will return to other modules within this course as required later on. These may include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Module 4: Digital News Sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Module 6: Government and Policy Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Module 8: Digital Primary Sources and Digital Scholarship&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Module 10: Special Collections Fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to the Library at the University for making this course available, not least this introductory video which serves to ensure that students are in the right place. It allows me to gracefully and hopefully quietly let myself out of the rest of the course for now and get back to something more pertinent to my study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-1-introduction-getting-to-know-you-and-starting-out&quot;&gt;Week 1: Introduction, getting to know you and starting out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aims are to introduce &lt;strong&gt;the course&lt;/strong&gt;; introduce &lt;strong&gt;students&lt;/strong&gt; to each other; to signpost essential &lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;resources&lt;/strong&gt; for postgraduate research at Edinburgh; and to encourage PGR students to consider, discuss and reflect on &lt;strong&gt;expectations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed the five tasks presented in the first week of the course: an introduction post; reading basic policy and information on PGR at Edinburgh; another post on my hopes and fears; uploaded a photo of my workspace and another post describing my research to a 10-year old. I read and commented on a few posts in the various forums attached to these tasks. There were some useful links to pick up on, mostly Twitter or RSS feeds related to (hashtag) PhD Life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-2-achieving-first-milestones&quot;&gt;Week 2: Achieving first milestones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aims are to identify key &lt;strong&gt;milestones&lt;/strong&gt;; to introduce the importance of &lt;strong&gt;planning&lt;/strong&gt; time and research; to highlight some &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt;; to encourage reflection into your own personal and professional &lt;strong&gt;development&lt;/strong&gt; and identifying strategies for it; to discuss &lt;strong&gt;expectations&lt;/strong&gt; of the supervisory relationship and consider different styles of &lt;strong&gt;supervision&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week introduces more basic tools and strategies for planning including to-do lists, mind-mapping and timelines. I like and use many of these, and think I have settled on a decent workflow to help me with the PhD, however I may try some more sketch-based ideas too, in this week’s task for my supervisors (which I am oddly stuck at). There is a course on Learn to help you choose a reference manager, too closely linked to another called, &lt;em&gt;Producing your thesis or dissertation in Word.&lt;/em&gt;, which to me sounds like, &lt;em&gt;Building your extension in Lego.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I took up this PhD is that I feel that my productivity levels are higher than they have ever been, not least because of the rate I can write and assemble information but also because of the workflows I have established in my working life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;task-1--planning-approaches-and-tools&quot;&gt;Task 1 – planning approaches and tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approach to planning work and time
 I have a full time job, but one that varies from day to day and requires detailed planning using a range of tools. These same tools are needed in studying with a few exceptions I will try (see question 2). Current tools include to-do lists; Gantt charts; GitHub documentation control; text editors; diary and calendar including writing blocks; out-of-office.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What new approach could you try? 
 Some students have organised themselves into day-long writing sessions which are semi-social in that they are located in a cafe, have 90-minute writing blocks with 15-minute social breaks. I think I’d like to try one of these if I can find a day but I think they will be effective if I can add cadence to that habit by making it &lt;em&gt;every Friday&lt;/em&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The other “new” approach is the visual timeline, related to the third part of this first task. Pen and paper – sketch note style, to start with, before committing to text and code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a planning timeline for your first three or six months
 I don’t feel comfortable sharing my detailed plans as they are subject of current discussion with my supervisors. I will post the current generic Gantt chart, only slightly different from the proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;task-2--training-needs-analysis-and-the-rdf&quot;&gt;Task 2 – training needs analysis and the RDF&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vitae.ac.uk/researchers-professional-development/about-the-vitae-researcher-development-framework&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; from previous travel along this road but still completed a training needs self-assessment against the framework. This tool is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://edin.ac/2plM6v6&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as an Excel spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;task-3--working-with-your-supervisor&quot;&gt;Task 3 – Working with your supervisor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was quite easy for me to think about because I already know the work and styles of both of my co-supervisors who are colleagues at Moray House. We have begun working out our &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt;, with habits and expectations emerging as we meet over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-of-week-activity--picture-my-research&quot;&gt;End of week activity – Picture my research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are asked to post an image of something related to your research topic and describe (it) in a few words. I found this delightful quote from Doris Lessing to go with those few words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Doris.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My research begins with an analysis of a particular genre of radio broadcasting with the aim of identifying and revealing its hidden pedagogy. I hope to go on to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-3-making-the-most-of-your-time-and-overcoming-common-challenges&quot;&gt;Week 3: Making the most of your time and overcoming common challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-feeling-overwhelmed&quot;&gt;Avoiding feeling overwhelmed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m confident that I have some fairly good habits when it comes to time management, and yet am still prone to distraction. I’m trying to use a &lt;em&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/em&gt; application on my laptop and phone to make spaces in which I can focus on blocks of work and study. This has been quite effective at sustaining focus, although the keep-awake ticking of the electronic &lt;em&gt;pomodoro&lt;/em&gt; is really irritating. I’ll probably ditch it as more unnecessary distraction!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impostor Syndrome is a very real thing but both of my supervisors have been very good about helping me feel that the work I am doing is both interesting, worthwhile and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noting down achievements is a habit I have been using now for over a year in my work, and this has carried over into my PhD. Partly for fear of forgetting something important I keep detailed lists of thing to do, arranged into a timeline. This remains open on my desktop except when I’m diving into one of the blocks of work or study. I mark tasks that are completed and at the end of each “reporting cycle” (i.e. a month), export a pdf as a record achievement (and proof I have been worked very hard, boss). This method is easy enough because all of the writing I do, including these task lists, is done in Markdown, which has a checkbox syntax built in to the versions I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am appreciative of the advice based upon experience shared by other PhD students more advanced than the rest of us, in particular their frank and heartfelt sharing of how they responded to setback and other challenges they experienced as researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-the-most-of-time&quot;&gt;Making the most of time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part of the course opens up possibilities for collaboration and networking, which I am not ready for yet. I have discussed these briefly with my supervisors and will pick up on this idea a little later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-writing&quot;&gt;Focus on writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a self-audit of how I feel about my writing skills and abilities, I am confident…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the basics of academic writing – eg. sentence structure/ grammar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;about the academic writing conventions for my discipline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;about writing about data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;about referencing and know what is required&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in writing about my research in other ways eg. for a blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a useful “getting started”. My final post on “one take away from the course”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More than anything else, I’ve learned that being insecure, impostor syndrome, being distracted and worrying about things going wrong are normal. I’m especially thankful to those who have shared with us here, because I am encouraged and feeling stronger now, more than ever, about my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Introduction to Text Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I booked on to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/introduction-text-analysis&quot;&gt;CDCS Introduction to Text Analysis&lt;/a&gt; 2-hour course and installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nltk.org/install.html&quot;&gt;nltk&lt;/a&gt; in preparation. This 2-hour “silent disco” online event is an intermediate Python course on using the NLTK package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-to-text-analysis&quot;&gt;Introduction to Text Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop uses Notable but I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-exploits.edina.ac.uk/intro-ta/files/intro_text_analysis-2021.ipynb&quot;&gt;notebook&lt;/a&gt; in Visual Studio (because it’s a good IDE). The notebook is written in markdown text with code blocks interspersed in “cells” throughout the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop begins with some exercises in the IDE to get used to running python code within the cells to do something with text strings, using variables, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ada&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;lovelace&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;full_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos; &apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# combine strings with a space inbetween
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;full_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;file-handling&quot;&gt;File handling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic file actions are rehearsed including opening and reading a file, and using text manipulation functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python3&quot;&gt;file = open(&quot;origin-intro.txt&quot;)

txt = file.read()
txt = txt.lower()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nltk&quot;&gt;NLTK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python package NLTK provides a set of natural languages algorithms e.g. tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, sentiment analysis, topic segmentation, and named entity recognition. We played with some of these using the text extracts we had been given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tokenization&quot;&gt;Tokenization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text analysis begins with breaking down a block of text into smaller chunks such as words or sentences. This is called &lt;em&gt;Tokenization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;nltk&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;nltk.tokenize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sent_tokenize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# or word_tokenize for words
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;origin-intro.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# open file
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# add file contents to variable
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokenized_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sent_tokenize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokenized_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cleaning-text&quot;&gt;Cleaning text&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial part of this process in preparing for analysis is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the file and assign it to a variable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convert to lower case&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split into tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remove stopwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop” words are sometimes called filler words: they are the common words that don’t add much meaning to a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;nltk.tokenize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word_tokenize&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;origin-intro.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# open file
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# add file contents to variable
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# lower case text
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sa&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos;[^\w\s]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#remove punctuation (note use of regex)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokenized_word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word_tokenize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filtered_word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokenized_word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stop_words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filtered_word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Filterd Words:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filtered_word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-functions-and-libraries&quot;&gt;Further functions and libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working through the notebook, running code and downloading libraries as required, I was able to easily clean blocks of text; tokenize and count words; plot frequency distributions; tag parts of speech; identify common bigrams and n-grams (word pairs and n-word groups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fun-with-trump&quot;&gt;Fun with Trump&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A delightful bit of fun was had analysing President Trump’s Tweets using this code to fetch the text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;urllib.request&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos;https://learn.edina.ac.uk/intro-ta/files/trump-tweet-archive.csv&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# download the file
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urlopen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# assign the contents of the file to a variable (csv)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos;tweets.csv&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos;wb&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# create a new file and save the contents of &apos;csv&apos; to this file
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos;CSV file created&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think was the top 4-gram in all of this data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;make america great again! 390&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very nice way to run through a tutorial notebook and learn a few tricks in python for text analysis, with support running in the background if I needed it. The format is powerful; it focuses you on the task within the time window allocated and helps you avoid distractions. Although it’s self-study (and as such relies on good quality materials in the first place), it’s OK to play a bit too, because there’s help at hand if you come unstuck. Well done, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/training&quot;&gt;CDCS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>LibSmart I</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This introductory course provided by the University of Edinburgh’s library is structured in five modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;module-1-getting-started-with-the-library&quot;&gt;Module 1: Getting Started with the Library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing and using online library resources for your studies. This begins with the task of setting up a “Pebble Pad” blog (the reason for which isn’t apparent), which itself begins with a series of “helpful” videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find video an extremely frustrating and patronising format and will always prefer to read a few well-chosen words that cut to the chase. Almost every instructional video I have ever seen seems to have been designed to meet a requirement to have video as part of the instruction tools. I have never seen one that was better than words on a page. I include the videos I have made in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to access online library resources&lt;/em&gt; provides basic access information including how to set up the VPN, and how to navigate the menus in the MyEd university landing pages to find library search tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://discovered.ed.ac.uk&quot;&gt;DiscoverEd&lt;/a&gt;. The video for this section is available as a pdf: it’s as if someone’s listening! &lt;em&gt;Understanding and Accessing Your Reading List&lt;/em&gt; isn’t at first sight relevant to PhD – because there are no reading lists for PhD – but it’s possible to look in on other courses or browse the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eu01.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/readinglist/searchlists&quot;&gt;Resource Lists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Start Searching DiscoverEd&lt;/em&gt; offers some practice with the university library search interface as well as again providing stats on how much stuff there is in the library. The module finishes with &lt;em&gt;Making the Most of Library Resources&lt;/em&gt; which shows how to find help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been helpful to return to basics in this module and check that I’m not missing anything fundamentally useful in accessing the library. I have found the library interfaces generally quite self-explanatory and intuitive to use, especially if you take the time to read the interface carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eu01.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/44UOE_INST/lists/27615489290002466?auth=SAML&quot;&gt;Study Skills Guides&lt;/a&gt; - a resource list for all students, covering general study skills, academic writing, referencing, critical thinking, reflective writing, literature reviews and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;module-2-your-information-landscape&quot;&gt;Module 2: Your Information Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore and use key library resources appropriate to your discipline. Useful areas here include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://edinburgh-uk.libguides.com/Education-and-Teacher-Training&quot;&gt;subject guide for Education and ITE&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/1_qb7es7qm&quot;&gt;video on literature search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modules-3--5&quot;&gt;Modules 3 – 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These address finding and retrieval; managing information and referencing. I went through these quickly to see what’s new or useful. From these…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;identifying-source-categories&quot;&gt;Identifying source categories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information sources can be broadly categorised into three types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primary or original sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secondary sources provide interpretation, commentary or analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tertiary or reference sources are dictionaries, encyclopaedias or indexes of primary and secondary information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evaluating-information&quot;&gt;Evaluating information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very useful stick-on-the-wall guide to selecting literature was published by the Meriam Library at California State University &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#MeriamLibrary-CaliforniaStateUniversityChico2015&quot;&gt;(2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;bibliography&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;MeriamLibrary-CaliforniaStateUniversityChico2015&quot;&gt;Meriam Library - California State University Chico. 2015. “Evaluating Information – Applying the CRAAP Test,” 17. https://www.csuchico.edu/lins/handouts/eval_websites.pdf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Purge your Mac of OneDrive</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t take much experience with Microsoft’s OneDrive to learn that it is an unmitigated car-crash: it purports to be a productivity tool that makes it possible to share files quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those used to the MacOS experience, with smooth drag-and-drop, quick look, finder previews and right-click extensions (I like “New Terminal at Folder”), the promise of doing the same for your work’s OneDrive as you do for your DropBox or ownCloud folders is enough to tempt you in to installing OneDrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done this, and realised that despite looking like a duck, it doesn’t walk like a duck, nor quack much. More of a woof, really. So, rather than be burdened by the workflow friction that Microsoft provides to the World’s economy, I resolved to (a) not use OneDrive unless I had to, and (b) stick to using the web interface when I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t log out, or stop the service – it had crashed anyway – just dragged the OneDrive.app from the Applications folder to the bin, along with anything that looked connected to it in these folders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~/Library/Application Support/&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~/Library/Containers/&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~/Library/Caches/&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~/Library/Preferences/&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~/Library/Cookies/&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~/Library/Logs/&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~/Library/LaunchAgents/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empty the trash and you’re free of it.&lt;/p&gt;

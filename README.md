This repository is the source for a blog that contains posts on coding, technical matters, education, and research.

The site is based on [Jekyll Minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) and includes Kushagra's [search](https://github.com/chinchang/super-search).

I am a Lecturer at Edinburgh University and maintain an interest in programming and artificial intelligence. You can find my latest cv [here](https://github.com/NixImagery/CV/blob/master/cv.pdf) (pdf, 100kB).

<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/11/invictus.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-840" alt="invictus" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/invictus-300x173.jpeg" width="300" height="173" /></a>So, why am I publishing poetry readings? Simply because I was listening to BBC Radio 4's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03df77d" target="_blank">Poetry Please</a> and heard a rendering of Blake's The Tyger that I thought - well, not very good. I love Blake's verse and found myself shouting at the radio (I'm the kind of guy that shouts at inanimate objects) at the failure of the reader to make any real attempt to put a little passion into it. As is a common occurrence for a man with my over-inflated sense of his own capabilities, I thought I could do better.</p>
<p>So here are a few attempts to do better. Not being objective about how my own voice sounds to others, I wonder if they are any good. I'm not seeking flattery, but would appreciate your thoughts as to whether I should do any more, or stop now before I make other people shout at their computers.</p>
<p>If you don't comment, don't complain if I post more.</p>

<p>I picked up a little book on holiday this week and read the short biography of the editor. This revealed a career path from Grammar School to Cambridge to Public School to Eton housemaster which filled me with sadness and contempt for its utter lack of imagination.</p>
<p>Now, I know this is judgemental and probably wildly wrong but but this judgement seemed to be underlined when I read this editor's introduction to the book. It was safe, unadventurous and deadly dull. Having read it, I wish I hadn't wasted those precious minutes of my life doing so.</p>
<p>So, here is a stereotype of a man who was good enough as a child to secure a place at a Grammar School (I did, but the year they dropped the 11-plus). At Grammar School he was successful enough to go up to Cambridge. No doubt he was inspired by his role models, his teachers. Having read languages - with the whole wide world open right before him - he becomes as teacher. Straight back to the swamp from which he had just emerged.<!--more--></p>
<p>So lacking in imagination and character is he that he ends up in the most elite of elite social sausage factories, the kind of place described to me recently as, "<em>a place that takes lovely little boys and turns them into arrogant, repressed misogynists</em>".</p>
<p>You might be thinking that there's a lot of inference in what I've just written and you 'd be right. You'll have made a judgement about me and the kind of person I am, and may even have made up your own version of my life story to fit your impressions of me based upon what you've read. You'd be as wrong about that as I probably am about our editor friend. The interesting thing about this is that I can't know how I come across to you, no matter how hard I reflect. Even if I read this over again I have such a set of filters and lenses through which I look at myself, I cannot see what you see.</p>
<p>The Vampire is said to be unable to see himself in a mirror. Perhaps there is something of this in all of us.</p>

I am a Senior Teaching Fellow at Edinburgh Universityâ€™s Moray House School of Education, leading teacher education in science and physics across primary and secondary sectors.

Before spending time in education, I held technical and commercial roles in military operations, aviation, IT, simulation and training. Trade certifications include Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD). My interests include intelligent automation and the potential this has in teaching and learning.

My professional designations include [Chartered Physicist (CPhys)](https://membership.iop.org/chartered-physicist-cphys), [Chartered Scientist (CSci)](https://sciencecouncil.org/scientists-science-technicians/which-professional-award-is-right-for-me/csci/), member of the Institute of Physics (MInstP) and member of the Royal Aeronautical Society (MRAeS). I am a [Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/fellowship).

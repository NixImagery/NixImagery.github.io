<p>On a Delta Airlines flight a number of years ago, I was lucky enough to be sat next to the author <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ford">Richard Ford</a>. This must have been shortly before he picked up a Pulitzer for his novel, <em><a href=" http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0747585172/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0747585172&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachingistoe-21">The Sportswriter</a></em>. Neither of us probably recall the conversation during the flight but what I do remember is that (unlike me) he made no excuse of the environment and got on with writing: scribbling in a little notebook, staring out of the window, scribbling some more, in a cycle of what I have always presumed to have been the creative process.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it too easy to make excuses for not writing. Wrong environment. Too noisy. Any time slot less than an hour is not enough. Must check email. Need a biscuit. Text message. Look at that dust.</p>
<p>I was remembering Richard’s brilliant short story collection, <em><a href=" http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0747585253/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0747585253&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachingistoe-21">Rock Springs</a></em>, dug it out to read again and looked him up on the web to see what he was doing. I came across a short work that he had reviewed called <em><a href=" http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0307279413/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0307279413&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachingistoe-21">Several Short Sentences About Writing</a></em> by Verlyn Klinkenborg. This is a little treasure of advice for the writer: you dip in and pick up some important little nugget that will make you feel better about yourself and gently encourage you to get back to the task you’ve quite possibly been avoiding.</p>
<p>At least, that's how it worked out for me.</p>

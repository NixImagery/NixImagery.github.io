<p>... a crossword. One of the interesting things about being a producer of online material - whether that be blogs, learning resources, online community sites or crosswords, is that sometimes you get no direct response. Feedback is important so that you can gauge whether or not what you're doing is any good. If it's rubbish, you can consider whether it's worth the effort doing it again. If it's brilliant, you can be encouraged to keep doing it. If it's in between, you can find out how to improve it.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_851" align="alignright" width="182"]<a href="http://sptr.net/blog/category/puzzles/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-851" alt="Pixie Puzzle No8" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Pixie-Puzzle-No8-182x300.png" width="182" height="300" /></a> Click the puzzle.[/caption]</p>
<p>Some of the things I do online yield positive responses: the physics resources site I run over at <a href="http://sptr.net" target="_blank">sptr.net</a> gets little response online but when I meet users or engage in one-on-one email exchanges, I often get positive comments about how useful it is, and this encourages me to keep working at it. It's a nice feeling to be making lives easier.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you can work hard to put something "out there" and get little to nothing back. Two examples: one, is the audio commentaries and reflections I publish through <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/nick-hoods-boos/id549233518" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and <a href="https://audioboo.fm/cullaloe" target="_blank">AudioBoo</a>. Although most of these get thousands of listeners, which itself is gratifying, I almost never get a response. It's a bit like shouting at the radio. I know how that feels, I do it often enough.</p>
<p>The other example is the cryptic crosswords I have been publishing over the past year - 7 in total. As anyÂ cruciverbalist will tell you, these take quite a bit of effort to put together, even with the aid of the brilliant tool that I use, John Stevens' <a href="http://www.wordandnumberpuzzles.com/download.html" target="_blank">Magnum Opus</a> program. Despite a couple of thousand downloads, I have only ever received a handful of comments or solutions.</p>
<p>So. I saw a guy in Costa yesterday, settling down with the Saturday Times Crossword. He'd finished a substantial chunk of it by the time he got up to leave, so I wrote the web address of my most recent puzzle on a receipt and pressed it upon him and asked him to take a look and let me know what he thought. Bless his heart, he did so, posting the magic words, "Enjoyed the crossword...".</p>
<p>You have no idea how good that made me feel. Click the puzzle if you'd like to try one.</p>

<p>I'm just about to settle down and get stuck in to the week 2 material for #edcmooc which is tagged, "Looking to the Future". Before I read anything, I'm going to make a few observations on how I see looking to the future as a purposeful activity.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-357" alt="crystalballs" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/crystalballs.png" width="195" height="205" />Winston Smith would no doubt recognise the doubleplusgood duckspeak of much of today's pronouncements on education, if the future described by his creator wasn't so utterly way off the actual outcome. Hello. Is it me you're looking for? Lionel Ritchie was in the charts in the UK in 1984 and I, thankfully, was in Seattle doing some damned clever things for Boeing with software that you compiled overnight and stored on 20-kilo, 80MB disc packs the size of dustbin lids. I had TV-screen glasses, a moustache and a Suzuki v-twin. Some of you reading this will need to ask an older person what a dustbin lid is.</p>
<p>The track record for insightful forecasting of future worlds is pretty weak, in my experience. Nostradamus. Orwell. Wells. TV21 comic. Russel Grant. Mystic Meg. Jesus. Ian Smith. I have no reason to believe that the authors of the <a href="http://www.scotlandfutureforum.org/">latest four visions</a> of Scotland's education in 2025 will be any better than those.</p>
<p>So with that as context, I think I'm ready for a look at what can only be regarded as the fiction of the future and as one who has been called <a title="Why? Because I can't go up stairs easily at the moment, like the old-time Daleks.">Davros</a> in the past 24 hours, this should be entertaining.</p>

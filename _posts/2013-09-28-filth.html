<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/09/f2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-795" style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" alt="f2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/f2-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Jon Baird's film of Irvine Welsh's book, <a href="http://www.filthmovie.co.uk/"><em>Filth</em></a>, has to stand head and shoulders above almost all of the other movies I have seen in the past ten years, and certainly outclasses every one of those that was spat out by the regressive Hollywood machine. This movie is so different from those that it almost warrants a class of its own. If other films join it, they will undoubtedly be made in Scotland.</p>
<p>The story is set in the beautiful city of Edinburgh, and begins in a vein somewhere between <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jhp3l" target="_blank"><em>Ashes to Ashes</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewin'_the_Fat" target="_blank"><em>Chewin' the fat</em></a>, with plenty of proper Scots comedy, banter and swearing, as we see the central figure, Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), vie for promotion using every desperate measure he can think of. His misogyny is developed through the film as we see him struggle with the battle for promotion, a cocaine habit and something deeper. I'll not spoil the plot for you but be prepared for a significant shift in how you think about and empathise with Â Bruce Robertson, as McAvoy puts in the performance of his life in crafting the twisting evolution of the character on the screen before your eyes.</p>
<p>Be prepared also for some stunning visual comedy throughout the film, from the police party photocopy-your-penis contest to the expanding head of Roberston's shrink, played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent in a burlesque on the <em>Clockwork Orange</em> side of <em>Cabaret</em>. Watch out for Eddie Marsan's outstanding portrayal of Robertson's Masonic brother and victim Bladesey and a musical cameo from David Soul.</p>
<p>This is a stunning, stunning quality film, bound for cult status. Don't miss it.</p>

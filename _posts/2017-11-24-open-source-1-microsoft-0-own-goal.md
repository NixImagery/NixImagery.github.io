So, I'm sitting down to work on some stuff for my job that is in a Microsoft file format, because that's what the corporate world uses, when this message appears. I managed to sign in using my corporate id and their subscription.

What ticks me off is that I have already bought and paid for this software. It makes me even more determined to move to open source.

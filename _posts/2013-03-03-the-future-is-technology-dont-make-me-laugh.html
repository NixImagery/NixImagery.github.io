<p>The future is technology. So goes the idealistic vision of the future theme of edcmooc and the happy dreams of those who dream of a digital utopia in which our lives are enhanced by amazing geekery and <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-it-feels/">augmented reality</a>.</p>
<p>My world is different. Mine is a world in which technology doesn't work. It claims to work but forgets to mention the endless hours you will spend trying to get it do what you thought, foolishly, that it would do. Don't even mention the word "<a href="http://olliebray.typepad.com/olliebraycom/2013/02/scotlands-technology-for-learning-a-tipping-point.html">GLOW</a>" in my presence.</p>
<p>I bought a Sony Bravia TV because it had internet connectivity. It does, sort of, but not the way I understood it. It connects to a half-<a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/03/roku.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-553" alt="roku" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/roku-300x147.png" width="180" height="88" /></a>assed clunky version of the internet. It doesn't, after all, play stuff from the web. I doesn't let me browse. At all. I discover that I can jigger about with things to make it do that, sort of. I bought a Roku Media Streamer so I can stream digital media from my network to the TV. It does, sort of, but not the way I understood it. It has an interface clunkier than a clunky thing from clunky-land in the far forgotten time of the early nineties. I took it back. <a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/03/boxee.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-554" alt="boxee" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/boxee-300x200.png" width="180" height="120" /></a>I bought a Boxee Box which according to the manufacturers, does all the things I want it to do. It does, sort of, but not the way I understood it. It falls over a lot. The display is intermittently broken and it switches sound output on and off suddenly, threatening my lovely expensive speakers (which were made in the 1970's by the way and still work when not rapidly switched on and off by a dodgy boxee). I took it back.</p>
<p>I got an Asus Nexus Google 7 tablet which has had a flickering <a href="http://www.blipfoto.com/entry/2815270">display fault</a> since the day it arrived and despite being returned to the manufacturer twice, still has the fault. The audio output has never worked. I'm sending it back. Again.</p>
<p>The future may be technology but don't you rely on it doing what you think it will do. It will, sort of, but not the way you understood it.</p>

<p>I have a project I'm working on that requires the use of a data analysis tool like IBM's <a href="https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/buyingtools/paexpress/Express?P0=E1&amp;part_number=D0EKZLL,D0EEMLL,D0EK0LL,D0EEJLL&amp;catalogLocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US&amp;country=USA&amp;PT=html" target="_blank">SPSS</a> but at about six thousand dollars per year, it's a little out of reach. There is an open source project, fortunately, that provides all the functionality I need for a lot less.</p>
<p>PSPP is, according to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/pspp.html" target="_blank">project website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...designed as a Free replacement for SPSS. That is to say, it behaves as experienced SPSS users would expect, and their system files and syntax files can be used in PSPP with little or no modification, and will produce similar results (the actual numbers should be identical). The number of variables and cases is limited only by the computer architecture."</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways of getting PSPP depending on your operating system: I am a Mac OSX user running 10.10.5 Yosemite so installed it using <a href="https://www.macports.org/" target="_blank">MacPorts</a>. As this is a brand new machine I'm installing it on, I needed to install MacPorts first: download and run the install package from the <a href="https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/" target="_blank">download page</a>, update and then run the install (you need super user privilege):</p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">$ sudo port selfupdate
$ sudo port install pspp
</span></pre>
<p class="p1">This will give you a working PSPP from the command line. If you want to use the graphical user interface over PSPP, known as PSPPIRE, you'll need to update your X11 DISPLAY driver by <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/" target="_blank">downloading and installing XQuartz</a> which is a community produced X-window server assisted but not supported by Apple. Once you've installed Quartz, you'll need to log out and in again to update the DISPLAY environment. Once this is done you can launch the GUI version of PSPP from the command line:</p>
<pre class="p1">$ sudo psppire</pre>
<p class="p1">This allows you to work with your SPSS data sets and command files almost without modification.</p>

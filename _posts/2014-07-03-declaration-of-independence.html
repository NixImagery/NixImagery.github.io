<p>A while ago, an old friend from my Sussex days posted on Facebook, "When are you coming home?". My response, to the applause of the crowd, was, "I <em>am</em> home". I love Scotland, or at least parts of it, and she has been quite kind to me since I came here in 1991 for what I had intended to be a maximum of 6 months.</p>
<p>I migrated involuntarily to Scotland 23 years ago out of economic necessity. My pedigree is not dissimilar to your average mongrel although I do have strong roots back 200 years through my American father's line to the Hoods of Dumfries. I am as proud of my heritage as I am of anything else I have no control over, like my height. "Proud" in the sense that I recognise it as my good fortune and something I should (and do) take full advantage of.</p>
<p>Something else I inherited from my father was his intolerance of pretension, although I think I can run with a line so far, before rebelling (this trait from the Bourne family, my mother's genetic base). This is what I often refer to as the "F*ck it" point.</p>
<p>I have reached this point in the debate over Scotland's independence. Listening carefully to both sides of the argument, I have found no imperative nor evidence to support the action of severing the leg we stand on in the United Kingdom. Neither the leg nor the amputee would fare well, although I suspect that the economic reality of our population distribution, one-eighth of it in London and 91% not in the metaphorical leg, the UK-not-including-Scotland will survive.</p>
<p>The vote in September is going to be made with people's heads, hearts and the (m)asses.</p>
<p>To intellectualise the argument, there is no economic or political advantage for Scotland to cede from the rest of the UK: our UK research investment, world investment, finance investment, European investment would be damaged substantially. Alec Salmond, clever cookie that he might be, has failed to convince anyone's head that a Yes vote is in anyone's interests.</p>
<p>Hearts will be bursting with nationalistic emotion, the halls and glens still echoing to the skirl of pipes and the choruses of "Caledonia" and "Flùr na h-Alba" at the end of the Glasgow games and the SNP will be hoping for a "games effect"  just in time for the referendum in September.</p>
<p>Finally, there is, despite all the hype, door-knocking, state-funded leafleting and propaganda, the most powerful political force of all: the disinterest of the masses. Here is the greatest vote, if not actually for the status quo, but against the change in it. For same reason I didn't engage with the rubbish waiter in the rubbish restaurant I had lunch in yesterday when he asked if everything was all right, people don't feel sufficiently interested in revolution or changing things for the better to engage in the argument. This is why you see a predominance of "Yes" stickers all over the place. There is the sense that to dissent from the nationalist zeitgeist is somehow anti-Scottish, not something to be in times of Nationalist fervour.</p>
<p>Well, I am at the F*ck it point with this debate. Blame my breeding. I am going to vote against independence: because I love Scotland (parts of it); because there's no argument for it that even remotely sounds convincing to me; because as part of the UK, Scotland punches above its weight and I like that; and because it's right to stand up against Nationalism in this insidious form. I declare my independence.</p>

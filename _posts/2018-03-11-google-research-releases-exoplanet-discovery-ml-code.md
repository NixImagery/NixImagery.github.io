This week, Google Research released the AI code used in the discovery of two new exoplanets. [Their article](https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/open-sourcing-hunt-for-exoplanets.html) includes an accessible intro to planet hunting and machine learning for those interested in either topic.

The associated paper is mostly about the AI but includes a good sense of just what real planetary research looks like and how far it’s come: *Shallue, C.J. &amp; Vanderburg, A., 2017. Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning: A Five Planet Resonant Chain around Kepler-80 and an Eighth Planet around Kepler-90. The Astronomical Journal, 155(2), p.94*.

There’s an interview with Chris Shallue, the lead author on the paper on the [TWIMLAI podcast](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-117-discovering-exoplanets-deep-learning-chris-shallue/) which makes interesting listening for anyone interested in machine learning, AI or exoplanetary research.

This afternoon I attended the SSERC Virtual Summer School session on Diagnostic Questioning, presented by Stuart Farmer. This was a remote version of the session under the same name and received well previously. Apologies for the very terse notes - I've not had time to write them up (and it's now nearly 3 months later).

Listening to [Linux Unplugged 307](https://linuxunplugged.com/307), which featured a discussion on NextCloud and its various features, prompted me to check the software state of my own instance running on my VPS[^VPS].

Logging in to the admin interface, it was easy enough to update to the latest version 15.0.8, automatically. I took a look at some of the apps mentioned in the podcast: I am using calendar, contacts, email and files on a daily basis, all fully integrated with my (mostly Mac-based) business workflow. 

I'm not tempted much by the notes app because the OSX- and IOS-based email notes work very well on all of my devices except Linux machines. This isn't a problem, but wouldn't it be nice to have a fully device agnostic notes solution?

Finally, the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API app was quick and easy to set up within the dashboard. I now know when it's raining.

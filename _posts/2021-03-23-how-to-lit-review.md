Getting an effective literature review down is important for several reasons, not least of which it will immerse you in the topic or field you are looking at and give you a decent grip on what is known about it, and what isn't. This is enough justification for doing a literature review -- to become an expert on a subject -- but there are other motives, such as being able to convince others that you know what you're talking about; that your proposed research or study is worth investing in; that you are serious and committed to a proposed project; that there are new frontiers yet to explore.

## Purpose
For social sciences, literature reviews are often associated with new research to show how and where it fits in with what has been done before: they locate the research within a field of study, providing context, and identifying areas that need to be strengthened or filled.

## How they work
To get started with your own literature review, find 4 to 6 literature reviews and look at what they look like. Deconstruct them to see how they work: a literature review should *identify a research question* that provides the central topic of interest; it should *provide the "hook"* that explains why the research is relevant, interesting, timely or important; it should *cite important people* who are writing in the field; as the author of the review *establishes authority*, they *note the gaps* in the literature that the proposed new research addresses. When writing about what the literature says, it's not necessary to write everything that is known -- a good literature review will keep tightly focused on the research question (and within the word count).

## Getting started
A sketch or visual representation can help organise your thinking and understanding when writing a literature review. Steps to this are:

* find the literature (e.g. Google Scholar), noting how well cited they are
* screen (scan) about 20 articles to check they are on the topic.
* within those articles, look for themes -- of agreement or disagreement, cultures, or contexts

Take a large piece of paper and draw what you have found -- a hierarchy, spider diagram, or anything visual that helps you make connections, connect authors to themes -- show gaps in a different shape. Now look for what's missing in the chart -- step back to do this, and use your common sense to see the overall shape, structure and connections in the literature as well as the gaps.

The written literature review is a description of the chart that will make way to introduce your research proposal.

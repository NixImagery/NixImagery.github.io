<p>According to a popular Internet Meme, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs has a fundamental extension in the modern age - we all seem to need WiFi in order to function.</p>
<p>This need has created a fabulous opportunity for thieves. The term "WiFi" is a synonym for a Wireless (radio) Local Area Network or WLAN. Some WLANs may be password protected but many are not - these "open" networks are found in public spaces, provided by towns or shopping centres to attract trade. In open networks all devices in range can access the network's resources - i.e. read what you're typing.</p>
<p>Given that, why would you broadcast your login details, bank data, personal information and private conversations in an open space for all and anyone to listen to, take note of, and make use of at their convenience?</p>
<p>The best defence is to make sure that all internet activity on your mobile devices is sent over an encrypted, secure, connection. The WiFi providers don't guarantee this, so you have to bring your own in the form of a Virtual Private Network or VPN.</p>
<p>Many corporate employers provide a VPN for staff to ensure that they are not exposed to commercial risk or litigation from data leaks. If that's not available to you, you can use a service to keep yourself safe: my own personal choice is <a href="https://www.goldenfrog.com/UK/vyprvpn" target="_blank">GoldenFrog's VyperVPN</a>. It costs a few dollars a year but has fast support and secure servers worldwide. You would normally use a nearby server for speed but if you're trying to watch the BBC iPlayer in a bar in Prague, you can just connect via the London server to virtually relocate yourself back home to enjoy the latest episode of East Enders. I recommend you don't use the apps they provide - they don't work very well and will more often than not just stop you from using the internet. Manual configuration is the way to go: follow the <a href="https://support.goldenfrog.com/hc/en-us/categories/200206526-VyprVPN-Manual-Setup" target="_blank">Vyper guide here</a>.</p>
<p>So, a VPN helps keep you safe by encrypting all of your data sent over WiFi; it also works for 3G/4G; and it can virtually relocate you to somewhere you aren't. What it won't do is protect you from stupidity - you still have to take care that you aren't using easy passwords, you don't use the same password for everything, and you know who's looking at your screen, for example.</p>
<p>Finally, the image of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs above doesn't really need that big box for WiFi. To be understood in the modern age, we should really put WiFi usage in the Belonging or Self-Esteem levels, but be aware that every user should take action to ensure that Safety is taken care of.</p>

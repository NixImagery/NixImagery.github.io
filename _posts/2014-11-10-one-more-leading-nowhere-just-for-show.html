<p>Something that exercises student teachers and old hands alike is multiple definitions of "things educational." Similar-sounding terms are used to describe things that are, to different people, different.</p>
<p>An example of this came in an email from a PGDE student who, having witnessed a group of experienced educators (a) discussing the ignorance of those who don't know, at the same time as (b) avoiding directly answering the question themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>"What is the difference between interdisciplinary, cross curricular and multi disciplinary?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Great question. In <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/Images/building_the_curriculum_3_jms3_tcm4-489454.pdf" target="_blank">Building the curriculum 3 - a framework for learning and teaching</a> (BTC3), Education Scotland (ES) states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective interdisciplinary learning:<br />
&gt; can take the form of individual one-off projects or longer courses of study<br />
&gt; is planned around clear purposes<br />
&gt; is based upon experiences and outcomes drawn from different curriculum areas or subjects within them<br />
&gt; ensures progression in skills and in knowledge and understanding<br />
&gt; can provide opportunities for mixed stage learning which is interest based.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the carefully avoided definition. If you go to ES's page <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/learningteachingandassessment/learningacrossthecurriculum/interdisciplinarylearning/about/what.asp" target="_blank">What is interdisciplinary learning?</a> there is another paragraph not telling you what IDL is, together with a link to the wrong page in BTC3. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interdisciplinary learning enables teachers and learners to make connections across learning through exploring clear and relevant links across the curriculum.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you find any of those (clear and relevant links across the curriculum) in the Es and Os, let me know. Two broad types of IDL are described in BTC3, "which, in practice, often overlap":</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning planned to develop awareness and understanding of the connections and differences across subject areas and disciplines.</li>
<li>Using learning from different subjects and disciplines to explore a theme or an issue, meet a challenge, solve a problem or complete a final project.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021105309984" target="_blank">Ivanitskaya et al, (2002)</a>, the characteristic of IDL is the integration of multidisciplinary knowledge across a central theme or focus. So IDL is MDL? And it goes across a theme? So they're the same thing? Dictionary time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>interdisciplinary</strong>: adjective<br />
relating to more than one branch of knowledge. <em>(So, BioPhysics is interdisciplinary.)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>multidisciplinary</strong>: adjective<br />
combining or involving several academic disciplines or professional specialisations in an approach to a topic or problem. <em>(Like building a house: Plumber, brickie, joiner, electrician.)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>cross-curricular: </strong>adjective<br />
involving curricula in more than one educational subject. <em>(Speed, distance and time is in Maths and Physics)</em></p>
<p>Got it? IDL relates to more than one subject and may take a multidisciplinary approach and is probably cross-curricular. Cross-curricular doesn't necessarily mean interdisciplinary. IDL might not be multidisciplinary.</p>
<p>Comments welcome!</p>

![Creamy Hollandaise](/assets/img/IMG_9940 Large.jpeg#thumbnail) New Year's Day and the resolution list includes being more confident in the kitchen, so I aksed Alexa for a recipe for Hollandaise, which she obliged me with, from the [BBC Good Food website](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/hollandaise-sauce). It's very simple and straightforward and any fule can make this. Start by clarifying half a pack of butter in a small pan, skimming the white solids off the top as you heat it. Meanwhile, whisk up a couple of fresh egg yolks with white wine vinegar, a little salt, and a splash of cold water in a glass bowl, transferring the bowl to sit over some softly simmering water after a minute or two. Continue whisking until you get a nice pale, thick sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and gradually whisk in the butter to make a rich, creamy Hollandaise. 

Place all of the pans on the side ready for cleaning, and open a jar of Tesco's Finest Hollandaise sauce to spoon over your poached egg.

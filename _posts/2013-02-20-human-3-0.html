<p>Why 3.0? Let's characterise the development cycle of the human.</p>
<h3>Human 0.2 (Alpha Prototype)</h3>
<p>[caption id="attachment_533" align="alignright" width="134"]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Homo_erectus_new.JPG"><img class=" wp-image-533 " alt="Homo_erectus" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Homo_erectus.jpg" width="134" height="168" /></a> Homo Erectus (Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]</p>
<p>Homo erectus developed bipedal motion, migrated out of Africa 1.8 million years ago and quickly populated the old world, mastering fire 1.2 million years ago. The lighter and more adaptable variant, Homo sapiens, appeared in Africa 200,000 years ago and was more tolerant of the variation in diet caused by weather fluctuations, spreading to the rest of the world. All humans alive today are descended from a single female who lived in East Africa about 120-150 thousand years ago.</p>
<h3>Human 0.9 (Beta)</h3>
<p>From the time of this single woman, our most recent common ancestor (there are other ancestors, not common to all of us), expansion displaced the neanderthals, with the last of them dying out as recently as 25,000 years ago. Before about 50,000 years ago, social behaviours in humans were primitive and indistinguishable from the neanderthals. At this time, complex tools began to be developed by H. sapiens, and artwork appeared for the first time, indicating what is called, the Great Leap Forward. By the time we get to 30,000 years ago, there is ample evidence of figurative art, music, trade and burial rites. The evolutionary development of human intelligence is linked with either sexual selection or social competition, according to different models. There is also the not insignificant factor of improved diet leading to more advanced cognitive development. The last non-sapiens species of human, floresiensis, dies out 12,000 years ago.</p>
<h3>Human 1.0 (Production)</h3>
<p>The relatively modern human history of the past 10,000 years or so has seen the rise and fall of various social and political structures. The competition between these has brought us incredible advances in technology, transport, communication, infrastructure, health and weaponry. Metaphysical development has given us religion, politics, science and economics. The politics of the collective has yielded trade, nationalism, slavery, racism, class and empires in addition to these.</p>
<h3>Human 2.0 (Adaptation)</h3>
<p>The present revolution, which brings us globalisation, the internet, instant communication and transparency of events, is beginning to give us new expectations. We live much longer than our parents. We don't care what the skin colour or sexual habits of our facebook friends are. We speak English. We are losing patience with those who would get in the way of our freedom to choose our own path. Our energy and mineral resources are becoming critically precious. We are beginning to seek new economical and political models which will sustain us. We recognise that political groupings need to be educated as children do. This is the current model.</p>
<h3>Human 3.0 (Social Evolution)</h3>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/02/fsm.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-536" style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" alt="fsm" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fsm.jpg" width="330" height="170" /></a>So we arrive at my peek at where we go from here, reeking of my own prejudices and hopes. The New Human, physically very similar to our Beta ancestors, is socially and cognitively evolving away from our backward grandparents in another Great Leap Forward, stimulated by information and interaction. We have no need for rituals, religion or quackery. We make better choices to sustain our environment and resources. We manage production and reproduction. We are aware that elsewhere in our Galaxy, we have cousins who are evolving as we are but know that we will never interact with them. We are aware that it could all be Game Over at any moment and that there is nothing we can do about it. We are confident. We are happy.</p>

<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/05/condell.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-697" alt="condell" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/condell.png" width="109" height="161" /></a>I was sent an email recently which contained a link to one of Pat Condell's <a href="http://dotsub.com/media/b5ee5ada-5b37-4b0b-9916-e0896337ec4b/embed/eng">nasty xenophobic rants</a>.Â Personally, I find this guy to be of what we call here, the "Daily Mail" mentality. He represents the most xenophobic of southern English racist bigots, the kind of people like Nigel Farage and Nick Griffin, who will tell you all about a culture without ever having had any contact with it. He wallows in his own ignorance and promotes insular and neurotic stuff like this in the same way that Nazi sympathisers did about Jews, gays, gypsies and freemasons. Condell is viciously anti-religion and has been running his own personal campaign against all forms of religion and faith for several years now. He's actually an Irish ex-Catholic who is still bitter and twisted about the poverty his father's gambling and imprisonment brought. He's what my stepfather Frank would have described as, "someone who has nothing and wants to share it with everyone else".</p>

He promotes highly selective and factually incorrect portraits of religion, in this instance, Islam, wrapped in the Common Man's language of bar-room Common Sense logic and in so doing, promotes his own brand of personal insecurity to those unable to discriminate.</p>
<p>If you think discrimination is wrong, you make my point.</p>

In November, I took part in 4 weeks of a 5-week MOOC offered by the University of Edinburgh via the edX platform, [Data Ethics, AI and Responsible Innovation](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:EdinburghX+DEI01x+3T2020/course/). I had various difficulties with the course itself, culminating in a barrier to my continuing. 

You can read my notes on the course, including a personal reflection, at the [blog I kept on the MOOC](https://cullaloe.com/DataEthicsMOOC/).

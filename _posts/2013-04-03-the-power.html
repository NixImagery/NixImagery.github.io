<p>A teacher, relatively new to Social Media networks for professional development and education, posted this with a <a href="http://smarterlearning.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/twitonomy/">link to an interesting but not uncommon "test"</a> of the power of Twitter:</p>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/04/DH.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-672" alt="DH" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DH.png" width="466" height="71" /></a></p>
<p>We've seen these kinds of thing before, and they are a standard gimmick for presenters of CPD workshops on the use of social media. Do these tricks represent power, however? I think they demonstrate something: connectivity, reach, that the new "community" isn't restricted by geography or even timezone. By themselves, they do not demonstrate power. What is power? Whether you take the common usage or a stricter scientific definition, one could characterise "power" as the ability to change things.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps through jealousy or feelings of inadequacy, or maybe it's just my age (I should be buying a Harley), I'm deeply suspicious of philanthropy. I regard the motivations of those who would throw money around with suspicion. The arrogance of those who, through whatever means have found themselves with serious amounts of money, then pityingly and patronisingly share life-changing amounts of it with the "poor" or "disadvantaged", has always irritated me. If we had a fairer society, these benefactors wouldn't have such disgusting wealth in the first place, and nor would those who needed the help, need it as much, if at all. More to the point, the pet projects and politics of the philanthropist wouldn't prevail unfairly over more objective criteria.</p>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/04/cullaloe_2013-04-03.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-674" style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" alt="cullaloe_2013-04-03" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cullaloe_2013-04-03-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" /></a>So, in studying OER (Open Educational Resources) in the h817open mooc, it is mentioned in passing that, "Many OER projects have received funding from bodies such as theÂ <a id="yui_3_5_1_1_1364990003678_101" title="The Open University is not responsible for external site content" href="http://www.hewlett.org/">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>". My own experience in state education made me flinch at reading this. Whether open or not, I have seen that almost all educational resources used in public (state) schools are developed by the class teacher - often on their own time and at their own expense. Hours of time are spent preparing differentiated and engaging resources, often laminated and produced in expensive coloured paperstock, or set up as an online resource for all to use. The latter, as often as not, because the school-provided system is so awful and difficult to use as to become rendered useless. (I'm trying to get this written without mentioning <a href="https://secure.glowscotland.org.uk/login/login.htm">GLOW</a>. Ooops.). All of this, provided in a billion small acts of philanthropy, in those extra unpaid hours and the extra ten- or twenty-dollar expenses not reclaimed.</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/about-the-william-and-flora-hewlett-foundation/william-and-flora-hewlett-and-the-hewlett-foundation/william-redington-hewlett">Bill Hewlett's biography</a> with admiration and recognition that yes, he was a lovely man who leaves a lovely legacy. I have a positive regard for his company (I still carry around an HP-15C from the 80's). I just find that philanthropy is an unpleasant basis to built a sustainable society upon.</p>

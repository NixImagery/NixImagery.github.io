<p>Activity 3 in the Open Education mooc is to create a visual representation that defines "Openness in Education" by drawing on some of the concepts in Weller and Anderson. I chose to try a storywriting tool for this task after having struggled to think of a neat way of presenting the ideas without audio. My drawing skills aren't up to much, so settled on <a href="http://storybird.com">storybird</a>, which uses the work of artists on the site to put together a children's storybook.</p>
<p>You can play it full screen to make it easier to read the text.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <em>After a few days, the storybird people have pulled my representation from public viewing because "This story seems to be more suited to being published in a CLASS ACCOUNT". This doesn't suit my purpose at all, unfortunately, so I have wasted a great deal of time on Storybird for nothing. Yes, I'm annoyed. Watch out for a version 2 Â of the task shortly.</em></p>
<p>The story I have put together begins with Harold Wilson's idea which created the Open University, to whom I am grateful for my degree in Physics and Mathematics, upon which I have built a career, now in education. This career is concerned not only with pedagogy and the subjects I love, but also with the emerging revolution in technology-enabled networks which are bringing education to a massive population who would, in the traditional model of education, be forever condemned to social immobility.</p>

<p>I kept a link to Beall's list on my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDResources/">PhD Resources Reddit</a> and received a comment that alerted me to the post (reposted below) which reported the take-down of this incredibly useful resource.</p>
<p>Science itself is under attack by those governments, corporations and gangsters who profit from ignorance: Beall did a great service by "outing" bogus and fake journals who increasingly have been undermining the robust verification and publication of hard science findings.</p>
<p>The comment on the reddit post is available <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDResources/comments/5uxpzt/scholarly_open_access_critical_analysis_of/">here</a> and calls for a distributed response that is resilient to the challenges that cannot be sustained by one man in academia.</p>
<p>The post-truth era is here, now. Objective enquiry is under attack.</p>

I kept a link to Beall's list on my [PhD Resources Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDResources/) and received a comment that alerted me to the post (reposted below) which reported the take-down of this incredibly useful resource.

>Science itself is under attack by those governments, corporations and gangsters who profit from ignorance: Beall did a great service by "outing" bogus and fake journals who increasingly have been undermining the robust verification and publication of hard science findings.

The comment on the reddit post is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDResources/comments/5uxpzt/scholarly_open_access_critical_analysis_of/) and calls for a distributed response that is resilient to the challenges that cannot be sustained by one man in academia.

The post-truth era is here, now. Objective enquiry is under attack.

**Edit:** Updating this post in 2019, I discover that Beall's list is archived and sometimes updated [here](https://beallslist.weebly.com/).

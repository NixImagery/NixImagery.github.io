<p>Adobe has recently released an update for its Lightroom 5 photo management system which on OSX Yosemite does not work. The application crashes. I've gone through all the usual precious time-wasting permutations including completely uninstalling, clearing trash and reinstalling, even re-downloading from Amazon (where I bought it from a couple of months ago). The problem seems to be Adobe, like everyone else, is developing code for the majority market, i.e. the Microsoft Slaves.</p>
<p>A lot of Mac users, me included, operate with the flexibility of case-sensitive drives and here lies the problem. Adobe's sloppy coders have assumed that all systems are case insensitive. The error log gives a clue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Frameworks/asneu.framework/versions/a/asneu</p></blockquote>
<p>This library is actually located in the application folder in:</p>
<blockquote><p>/Content/Frameworks/asneu.framework/Versions/A/asneu</p></blockquote>
<p>Changing the path to match that expected by the application (V becomes v, A becomes a) allows it to run OK. I'm not aware of any other case-sensitivity issues with LR5.7 - it seems to work just fine.</p>
<p>Tip: if you're a LR user, the <a href="https://500px.com/lightroom" target="_blank">500px plugin</a> makes publishing to your favourite photo showcase easy.</p>

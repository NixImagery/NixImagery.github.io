<p>I don't have good <a href="http://cullaloe.com/blog/2013/05/23/android-its-still-faulty/" target="_blank">experience with Android devices</a>, not that I've ever actually bought one. My first device was a <a href="http://cullaloe.com/blog/2013/02/12/google-nexus-7/" target="_blank">Google Nexus</a> I won in a prize draw which was just a flaky piece of junk, even when they eventually sent me a new one after returning the original, with its faulty display, four times.</p>
<p>Luckily enough, I won an Amazon Kindle Fire in the University's <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/institute-academic-development/about-us/projects/digital-footprint" target="_blank">Digital Footprint</a> launch competition, which was handy - my reading list consists mostly of papers and articles that I manage with <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">Mendeley</a>. I can send pdfs automatically using the brilliant <a href="http://www.kinsync.com/" target="_blank">Kinsync</a> service, straight to my Kindle.</p>
<p>This morning, alas, myÂ Kindle Fire woke up dead. No response, even to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201178310" target="_blank">40-second reset</a>. I eventually found myself talking to Amazon support, who, because the device is still in warranty, have next-day shipped me a new replacement on the promise (and credit card collateral) that I send them back the dud. They're even paying the return postage. More than this I can't ask: it's certainly better than the "all our customers are morons" experience I had with Google.</p>
<p>So far, my experience with Android equipment has been worth every penny I've spent.</p>

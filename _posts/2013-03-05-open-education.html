<p>OK, so I'm on a roll here, having just completed Edinburgh University's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/edc">Coursera EDCMOOC</a> on e-Learning and Digital Cultures. I enjoyed participating in the open and online community that blew up around that mooc. That course helped me to develop my digital skills and deepen my understanding of the issues around being human in a digital age. It was one of my fellow moocers that made me aware of h817open (see below).</p>
<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2013/03/h817_b2-course_image.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-561" alt="h817_b2-course_image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/h817_b2-course_image.jpg" width="185" height="106" /></a>I'm interested in the developments taking place in education at the moment and in particular the move towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning">blended learning</a>. As I develop the teaching that I am doing, I am beginning to try out the use of <a href="http://cullaloe.net/">additional resources and activities</a> for my students to use outside of the core time for two main reasons. One, I think it enriches the learning experience for the student. Two, it offers better use of face-to-face time. There are other reasons to consider blended learning but these two seem to me to be principal justifications.</p>
<p>To extend my understanding of open learning, I've just signed up with the Open University for their mooc on Open Learning, <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/education/open-education/content-section-0">h817open</a> which begins formally on 16th March and runs for about seven weeks. The time commitment seems more realistically stated at about 16 hours per week, which I may or may not manage, but I'll certainly try to do it justice. I'm interested to see how the Mozilla <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> scheme works, too, having had an interest in <a href="http://cullaloe.com/curious/">gamification of learning as a motivator</a>.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>

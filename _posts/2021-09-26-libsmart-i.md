This introductory course provided by the University of Edinburgh's library is structured along basic lines: 

## Module 1: Getting Started with the Library
Accessing and using online library resources for your studies. This begins with the task of setting up a "Pebble Pad" blog (the reason for which isn't apparent), which itself begins with a series of "helpful" videos. 

I find video an extremely frustrating and patronising format and will always prefer to read a few well-chosen words that cut to the chase. Almost every instructional video I have ever seen seems to have been designed to meet a requirement to have video as part of the instruction tools. I have never seen one that was better than words on a page. I include the videos I have made in that.

*How to access online library resources* provides basic access information including how to set up the VPN, and how to navigate the menus in the MyEd university landing pages to find library search tools like [DiscoverEd]. The video for this section is available as a pdf: it's as if someone's listening! *Understanding and Accessing Your Reading List* isn't at first sight relevant to PhD -- because there are no reading lists for PhD -- but it's possible to look in on other courses or browse the [Resource Lists]. *Start Searching DiscoverEd* offers some practice with the university library search interface as well as again providing stats on how much stuff there is in the library. The module finishes with *Making the Most of Library Resources* which shows how to find help.

It's been helpful to return to basics in this module and check that I'm not missing anything fundamentally useful in accessing the library. I have found the library interfaces generally quite self-explanatory and intuitive to use, especially if you take the time to read the interface carefully.

This introductory course provided by the University of Edinburgh's library is structured in five modules. 

### Module 1: Getting Started with the Library
Accessing and using online library resources for your studies. This begins with the task of setting up a "Pebble Pad" blog (the reason for which isn't apparent), which itself begins with a series of "helpful" videos. 

I find video an extremely frustrating and patronising format and will always prefer to read a few well-chosen words that cut to the chase. Almost every instructional video I have ever seen seems to have been designed to meet a requirement to have video as part of the instruction tools. I have never seen one that was better than words on a page. I include the videos I have made in that.

*How to access online library resources* provides basic access information including how to set up the VPN, and how to navigate the menus in the MyEd university landing pages to find library search tools like [DiscoverEd]. The video for this section is available as a pdf: it's as if someone's listening! *Understanding and Accessing Your Reading List* isn't at first sight relevant to PhD -- because there are no reading lists for PhD -- but it's possible to look in on other courses or browse the [Resource Lists]. *Start Searching DiscoverEd* offers some practice with the university library search interface as well as again providing stats on how much stuff there is in the library. The module finishes with *Making the Most of Library Resources* which shows how to find help.

It's been helpful to return to basics in this module and check that I'm not missing anything fundamentally useful in accessing the library. I have found the library interfaces generally quite self-explanatory and intuitive to use, especially if you take the time to read the interface carefully.

#### Resources

### Module 2: Your Information Landscape
Explore and use key library resources appropriate to your discipline. Useful areas here include the [subject guide for Education and ITE](https://edinburgh-uk.libguides.com/Education-and-Teacher-Training) and a [video on literature search](https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/1_qb7es7qm).

### Modules 3 -- 5
These address finding and retrieval; managing information and referencing. I went through these quickly to see what's new or useful. From these...

#### Identifying source categories

Information sources can be broadly categorised into three types:

* Primary or original sources
* Secondary sources provide interpretation, commentary or analysis
* Tertiary or reference sources are dictionaries, encyclopaedias or indexes of primary and secondary information

#### Evaluating information

A very useful stick-on-the-wall guide to selecting literature was published by the Meriam Library at California State University {% cite MeriamLibrary-CaliforniaStateUniversityChico2015 -A %}.

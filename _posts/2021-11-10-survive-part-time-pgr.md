Another excellent online course provided by the University's IAD.

## Pre course Actions

We were asked, about a week before the course, to read an article in the [online Grauniad](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/27/how-to-juggle-a-full-time-job-and-a-part-time-phd) on *How to juggle a full-time job and a part-time PhD*; to think of *5 top tips* for being successful as a PT PhD; and bring questions of our own to the course.

Within the correspondence were also buried a couple of unannounced pdf attachments which contained resource for the course, I think, but also some links to blog posts and articles[^2021-11-10-blog1] [^2021-11-10-blog2] [^2021-11-10-blog3] [^2021-11-10-blog4] on doing a part-time PhD. One message stood out from these, beyond those that resonated with my own "top tips" (below), and that was this:

> students who study part time for their whole degree finish sooner and have better results than full time students.[^2021-11-10-pearson]

Wow, that is encouraging. I have a hope not to overrun on my own PhD, and finish early if at all possible but there are a lot of factors in that particular critical path, most of which I have no idea about. For now, I am focusing on sustaining the momentum by doing something every day, unless I specifically plan not to. It's working so far, and I have managed when external factors have confounded that approach.

Having a TBR (to be read) list is a good idea: I have one but it's huge and diverse. Next task is to organise and prioritise that. Lastly from the blogs, making use of buffer time that provides transition space between work, home and study. My job is closely related to my research and there is a "double divided" of much of the studying/thinking I am doing, so it matters less between work and study time, but I also need to be sure to be fully present at home: to not be nodding along to a domestic tale whilst mentally drafting some thesisable nugget. Working memory needs to be dedicated to whatever is current or in the moment. **Multitasking is your enemy!**

### My 5 top tips

Block out time
: You have to switch off everything that might distract you from your PhD. *Everything*. The only way I have been able to do that is block out time when I am doing nothing else but PhD work.

Have specific objectives
: That time should be spent working on something specific, whether tidying up your reference manager library, reading specific papers, searching for new ones or writing up notes.

Track achievement
: Have a to-do list that you check in on every day and check off the things you complete or progress. Watching that build into a record of achievement helps keep me keep moving forward.

Talk about your research
: I find it feels good to talk to other people about my research project. It is important and interesting, what you are doing. Tell people about it and what impact you hope to achieve. If you haven't got people, talk to a dog. Or a gonk.

Accept advice gracefully, and park it
: When you talk to other people, they may well have their own ideas or a book/paper/journal for you to read. Keep track of that stuff but sustain your immediate direction -- don't be distracted by what others think you should be reading. Make time for it when you can to check back on once you have progressed what you're working on *today*.

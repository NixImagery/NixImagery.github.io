    makes People</a><p>A new teacher recruitment campaign has been launched by Deputy
    First Minister John Swinney MSP.The ‘Teaching Makes People’ campaign targets university
    undergraduates studying science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects
    as well as people currently working in STEM industries.The campaign is based on
    research showing people attracted by and suited to teaching are generally motivated
    by helping to develop others and making the most of their own knowledge. It builds
    on the success of last year’s ‘Inspiring Teachers’ campaign which saw a 19% increase
    in applications for education post graduate diplomas (PGDE) at Scottish universities
    compared to the previous year.Mr Swinney launched the campaign at a careers fair
    at the University of Glasgow:“Teaching is a highly rewarding and inspiring career
    with opportunities for creativity and autonomy and, crucially, to make a positive
    difference to children’s lives. However, it is often overlooked as a career choice
    by the 20,000 or so STEM undergraduates who qualify from Scottish universities
    each year.‎“This campaign seeks to change this by targeting undergraduates and
    having a strong presence at careers events and on campuses across the country.
    This activity will be backed up by social media, online and radio advertising,
    and billboard adverts in specific locations.“Many STEM graduates might not immediately
    think of teaching or think that they have the skills for the role. This campaign
    aims to encourage more people studying or working in STEM related areas to think
    again and consider a challenging and rewarding career in teaching where they can
    make a positive difference.”</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheScottishGovernment/">The

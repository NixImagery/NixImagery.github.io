<p>I attended a seminar last week that raised a number of issues for me in relation to social justice and the dangers of that agenda. There is a <a href="http://cullaloe.net/w/index.php?title=Teaching_and_Educating_for_Social_Justice:_A_call_for_critical_teacher_education" target="_blank">fuller account of the session on the wiki</a> but I think it's worth making one or two further points in this forum.</p>
<p>First, the tippy-toeing around extreme, illogical or simply stupid ideas in the name of religious tolerance. One of these days, the human race is going to finally rid itself of voodoo, invisible friends and the brutal intimidation inflicted on itself in the name of religion. If anything needs a cold hard critical examination, it's this feature of our nascent society.</p>
<p>Second, alternate views do not become alternate-but-equal simply by being alternate. Jim Al-Khalili posted a great example of the difference between "a theory" like creationism and "a scientific theory" which makes this point well.</p>

<p>I will repeat again a question I have asked more than once this week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there any evidence that an "equal playing field" is better than one that isn't? Mother Nature's not so keen - she has very effective ways of rewarding power differential and privilege. I wonder if we remove competitive selection at our peril.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn't it time we stopped this conservative, white, naive egalitarianism? We could probably start with the pandas.</p>

<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/07/IMG_5843.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1213" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5843-300x235.jpeg" alt="IMG_5843" width="300" height="235" /></a>The General Teaching Council for Scotland has for the past few years been preparing for the introduction of a scheme of re-accreditation for teachers, required as part of <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/215/article/31/made" target="_blank">the legislation</a> which saw it gain "independence" from Government in 2012.</p>
<p>As with every other public body with an education remit, the GTCS can no doubt show that it has consulted widely and has "a regard to any views expressed by those consulted" [<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/215/article/31/made" target="_blank">1</a>]. The GTCS leadership have been at pains to distance itself from the competency overtones of the term "re-accreditation" and has positioned the professional update scheme, which goes live next week, as an enhancement of the annual professional review and development (PRD) process.</p>
<p>According to the GTCS website, I have to engage in the professional update process in August but, as with every other public body with an education remit, getting a clear statement of exactly what it is I have to do is difficult. I have a suspicion from talking to those involved in the pilot process that in the end, anything that from 500 yards looks like a duck, will be called a duck. "It's a skoosh", according to one participant.</p>
<p>This is familiar territory to anyone who has used the COSLA <a href="https://www.myjobscotland.gov.uk/home/" target="_blank">myjobscotland</a> website, which is clearly designed to show how the official bodies are working hard to operate an open, equal and fair process but which in fact delivers an awkward, dysfunctional and frustrating exercise in time-wasting for potential applicants. Reading Kafka is great preparation for using this site if you're considering it.</p>
<p>So, it's August next week and, like a lot of teachers, I have a lot of things to do during the so-called holiday period, including preparing for Professional Update. From the GTCS website today:</p>
<p><strong>28. When will I be required to complete the Professional Update process for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>From my GTCS number, I will be required to complete Professional Update in 2014/15.</p>
<p><strong>29. How should I be preparing for Professional Update?</strong></p>
<p><em>"From August 2014, engagement in the Professional Update process will be a condition of registration with GTC Scotland. National implementation will be on a phased basis, as outlined in the question above. Teachers will not be asked to provide retrospective evidence in the PRD process prior to 2014. GTC Scotland will continue to take every opportunity to communicate with the profession to ensure that all teachers are aware of the timescale of implementation, and what will be required of them to complete the Professional Update process."</em></p>
<p>A paragraph of text which doesn't answer the question by stating that GTCS will take "every opportunity" to answer the question. So, I get that this is something to do with the PRD process, which from the past decade I've spent in education, is a futile ticky-box role-playing exercise with absolutely no value whatsoever to me, the people I teach, nor the service. OK, I think I'm ready for that.</p>

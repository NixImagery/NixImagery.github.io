Yesterday, after a year in careful storage, the Sundial Memorial returned to a place of honour and inspiration in the newly re-designed quad in front of Old Moray House.

The memorial was made in 1998 to commemorate 150 years of teacher training and education here.

It stands now to inspire teachers from all over the world, whether just beginning their journey as educators, enhancing it or returning to it, of one of the most powerful aspirations and consequences of being an effective and transformative teacher: *know yourself*.

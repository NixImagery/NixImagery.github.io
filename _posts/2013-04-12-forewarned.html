<p>... the US Embassy has sent this helpful message to all registered US Citizens in the UK:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"U.S. Embassy London informs U.S. citizens that planned demonstrations regarding the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will take place at various locations throughout London from April 13-17. The planned demonstrations have been widely reported in local media and U.S. citizens are encouraged to monitor local media for updates about these planned events.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There is no indication that the demonstrations will be violent. However, even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. You should avoid areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations."</em></p>
<p>As if any US Citizen would be so rude as to join such nonsense.</p>

<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/11/J878-Memorial-Lecture-2014_Flyer-A5_web.pdf"><img class="alignright wp-image-1289 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/TC-212x300.png" alt="TC" width="212" height="300" /></a>How does a child open a door in the modern world? Children’s worlds are increasingly driven by algorithms. At what age are they able to understand these, and use their own? We need to consider how young children learn about computing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who has the responsibility and how do we support them?</li>
<li>What resources do we have and what else do we need?</li>
<li>When is too young, when is too late?</li>
</ul>
<p>On Wednesday 12th November at 5.30pm, the University of Edinburgh will be hosting a forum in memory of Tom Conlon which will engage with these questions through expert perspective and interaction with participants.</p>
<p>You are invited to join us, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>in person - free entry but booking is essential. Please register at: <a href="http://edin.ac/1lhONJ7" target="_blank">http://edin.ac/1lhONJ7 </a></li>
<li>on Twitter - please use the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23conlon14" target="_blank">#conlon14</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr Tom Conlon had a rare ability to make an impact in many diverse arenas. As a teacher, and as a lecturer at Moray House School of Education, his influence in the field of Information Technology is widely acknowledged. This forum commemorates Tom Conlon’s unique contribution by continuing to tackle relevant and important issues in education and computing.</p>

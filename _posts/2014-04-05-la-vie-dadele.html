<p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2014/04/lVA.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1017" alt="lVA" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lVA.jpg" width="379" height="257" /></a>I was loaned a DVD over the weekend as a distraction from an untidy pile of work which has been bugging me lately. The film seemed to be a bit long for a single sitting - 3 hours - so I kept the last hour for Saturday breakfast.</p>
<p><em>La Vie d'Adèle (Chapitres 1 et 2)</em> is a Palme d'Or winning film written, produced and directed by Abdellatif Kechiche. The story is based upon a graphic novel by Julie Maroh, <em>Le bleu est une couleur chaude</em> (Blue is the warmest color, the name of the film in English). The story is one of growing up as the eponymous Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos, left in the picture) concludes her school career before embarking on teaching. The crucial role of the teacher in bringing alive literature in particular and interest in the world generally is played out as a sub theme to the synchronous plot of Adèle's coming to terms with her sexuality. She makes mistakes - I thought her career choice was lazy - and suffers the consequences. The character presents as gauche and naïve despite her raw passion. Emma (Léa Seydoux, right) finds a muse for her art in Adèle but always remains the grown-up in their relationship.</p>
<p>The storytelling in the film is masterful, with Kechiche taking his time to bring out the nuances in each scene, never taking the procedural approach to capturing the moment, always letting it run. For some this may be irritating but if you can, watch this film and take your time to feel the moments as they unfold. If this film doesn't make you sob, you haven't been paying attention.</p>
